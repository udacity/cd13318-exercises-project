      "Eratosthenes was a Greek mathematician, geographer, and astronomer who developed a simple and effective method of measuring the Earth's diameter back in 240 B.C. Here is how his method works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Choose two places that lie on the same meridian (a circle of constant longitude passing through the North and South poles). Eratosthenes chose Alexandria and Syene (modern Aswan), in Egypt. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Determine the distance between these two places. This can be done in various ways such as measuring the time it takes to travel from one place to the other, or using geographic methods. Eratosthenes paid a man to walk the distance and count his steps. For our case, we can simply use the well-known distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. At local noon (when the sun is at its highest point in the sky) in one of the cities, measure the angle of the sunlight with respect to the vertical. This can be done by measuring the shadow cast by a vertical stick. In Syene, for example, there was virtually no shadow, meaning the sun was directly overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. At the same moment in time, measure the angle of the sunlight at the second city. In Alexandria, Eratosthenes measured this to be about 7.2 degrees, or about 1/50th of a full circle (360 degrees).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Given that the angles formed by the sun's rays at the two locations and the distance between them, you can use the principles of geometry to determine the Earth's circumference. If 7.2 degrees corresponds to the distance between Alexandria and Syene, then 360 degrees (a full circle which is the angle at the centre of Earth) would correspond to the entire circumference of the Earth. Therefore, multiplying the measured distance by 50 gives the circumference.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. To get the diameter of the Earth, divide the calculated circumference by π (approximately 3.14159). This is based on the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is π times the diameter.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Remember, the value obtained is an approximation, and the actual diameter of the Earth varies slightly due to it not being a perfect sphere.\n"

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 2: Measure the Angle of Sunlight\n",
      "\n",
      "Eratosthenes knew from travelers that on the summer solstice at local noon in the Ancient Egyptian city of Swenet (Syene) the Sun stood directly overhead. Under idealized circumstances, he could therefore use the shadow of a rod to find the angle between the vertical and the straight line to the Sun. This angle would be zero at Syene, as the Sun was directly overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Compare the Angle to the Shadow Cast in Alexandria\n",
      "\n",
      "In Alexandria, the vertical rod cast a shadow at an angle. Eratosthenes measured the angle of the shadow as approximately 7.2 degrees, or about 1/50 of a full circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Measure the Distance Between the Two Cities\n",

      "\n",
      "Step 5: Calculate the Size of Earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 7.2 degrees is 1/50th of a circle (360 degrees), Eratosthenes concluded that the distance between Alexandria and Syene was also 1/50th of the Earth’s circumference. To find the Earth’s total circumference, Eratosthenes multiplied the distance between the two cities by 50 (800km x 50 = 40,000km or 500 miles x 50 = 25,000 miles). This is a good approximation to the actual equatorial circumference of the Earth, which is about 40,075 km (24,901 miles).\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 6: Determine the Diameter of the Earth\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the diameter, divide the Earth's circumference by π (pi), usually approximated as 3.14. So the diameter of the Earth would be approximately 12,742 km (or roughly 7,918 miles). This value is very close to the modern value, validating the accuracy of Eratosthenes' calculation.\n"
