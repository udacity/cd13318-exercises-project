APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-11-70, 11:43 a.m. CST 1/1
This is Apollo/Saturn launch control we're T minus
1 hour 29 minutes 57 seconds and counting. Finishing up
at this time is the checks of the emergency detection
system. Skip Shovan the test supervisor now also making
some he's spacecraft test supervisor, making some checks
with the various members of the launch crew inside the space-
craft. The boost protective cover has now come closed. This
is the cover which will protect the spacecraft hatch both
from the jettisoning of the launch escape system and also
as it develops some friction as it goes up through the heavy
earth atmosphere. The crew now as they prepare the boost
protective cover will also be going around the white room
doing what's called breaking up the white room or generally
preparing it for retraction. Once the close-out crew departs
the white room area that white room will be retracted to a
stand-by position. It will remain in that stand-by position
down through the countdown to the T minus 5 minute mark,
at which time it will come back to the fully retracted
position. Now T minus 1 hour 28 minutes 52 seconds and
counting, this is Kennedy Launch Control.

This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, T minus
1 hour, 19 minutes, 58 seconds and counting. At this time
the closeout crew has reported from the white room that they
are in the last stages of clearing out the white room and
making it ready for its retracted position. Also going on
at this time are some computer checks with the launch vehicle,
these computer checks will be run continuously throughout
the final portion of the countdown to insure that the ground
computers are communicating properly with the corputers aboard
the space vehicle. The launch crew has been having some
problems with a vent valve in the first stage of the liquid
oxygen tank as mentioned earlier, the liquid oxygen as it
does boil off, is vented to the atmosphere. One of these
vent valves appeared to be sticking; that problem now does
appear to be solved and it has been brought closed. Now at
T minus 1 hour, 19 minutes, 8 seconds and counting, this is

This is Apollo/Saturn Launch Control T minus
1 hour 9 minutes 59 seconds and counting. At this time in
the command module, Odyssey, the three crewmen, spacecraft
commander Jim Lovell, command module pilot Jack Swigert, and
lunar module pilot Fred Haise are very busy. The spacecraft
commander and command module pilot are configuring the stabila-
zation and control system for liftoff and alining that system
with the guidance platform aboard the spacecraft. Also going
on at this time is a check of the large propulsion system
engine below the service module. This engine can be gimbaled
in response to commands. This is done in two ways and these
systems are being checked out at this time. There is a
thumb-wheel control which can set the engine to a preset position
for certain maneuvers and also a rotational hand controller
which can be used for the actual flight of a maneuver. These
checks. are being made now, the engine being gimbaled as space-
craft commander Jim Lovell indicating the position that he is
putting these to and readouts are being made to insure that
the engine is gimbaling a proper response. Also at this time
a final checkout by the crew of the entry monitoring system,
also a final setting of this system. Our countdown proceeding

APOLLO 13 STATUS REPORT, 4/11/70, 12:13 PM, CST
MC 4
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control. We're just passing
the 1 hour mark in our countdown. Now in the final hour
of the countdown toward the launch of Apollo 13. The close-
out crew has now left the white room area. They'll be standing
by for the retraction to the 12 degree position of swingarm
number 9. We've received word from the distinguished guest
site that the stands over there are near capacity with some
4500 guests in the area. The Vice President of the United
States, Spiro Agnew and Chancellor Willie Brandt, his special
guest, have arrived in the area, although they are not at
the stands yet. Out on the causeway, on a guest site, we
have 7000. This is the largest guest number that we have
ever had on our causeway site. To recap our countdown,
which has gone - preceded very well today we resumed the
count after a 9 hour and 13 minute hold at 4:13 A.M. this
morning. At that time the cryogentic loading began. This
is loading aboard the extremely cold liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen. Liquid hydrogen is a fuel for the second and third
stage, liquid oxygen the oxidizer used on all 3 stages. RP
or rocket perpellant number 1 is the fuel used in the first
stage. It is a kerosene type fuel and was loaded before the
countdown demonstration test back in mid March. The cryogenic
loading went well. There is over 800 000 gallons of cryogenics
loaded aboard the Saturn V vehicle at this time. We entered
a 1 hour build in hold, this is a planned hold at the T-minus
3 hour and 30 minute mark. The crew was alerted this morning
shortly before 9:00 A.M. by Colonel Tom Stafford, Chief of
the Astronaut office. They then proceeded for a short but
brief medical examination by Dr. John Teegen and Dr. Alan
Harter. They were pronounced in good shape and ready for
their flight. They then had the traditional breakfast of
steak and eggs, tenderloin steak, eggs, orange juice, coffee,
jelly and toast. After a brief mission briefing, they donned
their space suits and took the 8 mile trip in a transfer van
to the pad area. They have now been in the spacecraft going
through a variety of tests and checks, going over all their
switch lists and SO on. Our weather at this time is better
than had been predicted earlier. We're still looking for some
clouds to move into the area and will be expecting a temperature
of approximately 80 degrees at our launch time. We continue
counting down toward a launch time of 2:13 P.M. EST. Now at
T-minus 57 minutes 15 seconds and counting this is Kennedy
Launch Control.

The closeout crew has now left the white room, we are standing
by for the retraction of the swing arm, swing arm number 9.
That's actually scheduled to come at the 43 minute mark in the

This is Mission Control, Houston. At the present
time the flight controllers here in Mission Control are monitoring
the countdown and the status of the crew, the launch vehicle,
and the spacecraft. The world-wide manned space flight network
is up ad ready to supportthe launch. We do have a problem with
the Vanguard tracking ship down in the Mid-Atlantic. A tracking
data processor, we understand, is down on the Vanguard and we
will not get high speed radar tracking unless this problem is
cleared up. The Vanguard is a desirable element of the tracking
network, but is not essential, and we ar GO to continue the
launch with that problem. Just a few minutes ago, Ken Mattingly,
who until a few days ago was the prime command module pilot for
Apollo 13, arrived in Mission Control and Ken will be assisting
at the CAP COM console and he's joined astronaut John Young and
astronaut Joe Kerwin on the CAP COM console. As he arrived in
Mission Control, Flight Director Milton Windler greeted him and
said, "Sorry to see you here, Ken." This is Mission Control,

at this point and have indicated they are on station and ready to
support the launch of Apollo 13. The prime crew inside the
spacecraft at this time, left the Manned Spacecraft Operations
Building at Kennedy Space Center at 11:07 AM EST this morning
on their way out to the pad. They took the 8 mile trip in the
transfer van, went up to the white room level where spacecraft
commander Jim Lovell was the first one to board the spacecraft
at 11:32 AM. He was followed by the lunar module pilot who
moved in, Fred Haise moved into the right-hand seat at 11:32.
The command module pilot stood by in the elevator with a suit
technician, was the last one to come aboard. He came aboard at
11:44 AM EST. We are now standing by for retraction of the white
room. That should occur in approximately 47 seconds. When it
comes back, it will come back in a 12 degree or standby position.
From this position it cam be quickly brought back to the command
module if there is a need for the crew to egress or if we need
to get a team in to the crew. At the T minus 5 minute mark in
the countdown, the swing arm number 9 will come back to the fully
retract position and it will then stay in the fully retract
position throughout the launch. Once the white room has been
moved back to the 12 degree position, the launch escape tower
above the command module will be armed. Now standing by for
the movement of the swing arm 9, some 5 seconds from this time.
T minus 43 minutes and counting, and swing arm 9 should be
coming back. Swing arm 9 moving back now to the 12 degree position
is about some 10 feet now from the spacecraft. We now have word

start. This will put us on an automatic sequencer and the
remainder of the count from that time will be on automatic.
The sequencer can check out literally hundreds of items in
the space vehicle at the same time the team here in the
launch control center will be monitoring redline values.
These are such things as temperatures and pressures which
we do not want to either go above or below. A final com-
munications check now. The astronauts on the astrocomm

this would have any serious effect on the translunar injection.
The fact that we did consume a bit more propellant out of
the third stage than was originally planned. We are standing

and the culmination of the efforts of man
to improve his destiny is probably greater in this program
than anything we've ever turned our national attention to,
and I can assure you that we appreciate that very much. Again,
it's a pleasure to be with you and congratulations again on
your outstanding accomplishments.
KING
May I now introduce his excellency, the
Chancellor of West Germany.
BRANDT Thank you very much. Mr. President, I just
wanted to say that I feel honored and deeply grateful to have
been invited to the launching of Apollo 13 and to have this
opportunity not only to extend my personal good wishes for the
successful journey to the astronauts, but also to congratulate
all those of you, those who are here and many others in this
great country who have prepared and are actively involved in
this project. This is already the fifth time that men are
about to leave, or have left as a matter of fact, for the moon.
For that no less daring an undertaking and no less exciting
to anyone who had the privilege of watching it. In Germany,
and I'm surein all of Europe, people will follow this trip
with the same keen interest and the same emotion as everybody
in the United States. You here, gentlemen, together with all
your colleagues, indeed are going in peace for all mankind and
on behalf of all my countrymen, I wish that this not only
will be a successful trip and a safe return, but further progress
for mankind. Thank you very much.
KING Your Excellency, we in the American space
program very much appreciate your kind words. We would like
to give you a memento of your visit to Cape Kennedy to witness
the launch of Apollo 13. We thought that a Saturn V rocket
would be the appropriate memento, but it was too large to get
into your airplane, SO we have a somewhat smaller version here
which we hope that you will take with you as a reminder of the
successful launch of Apollo 13.

the pass over the United States, out over the Atlantic, Cap Com
Joe Kerwin gave the crew a preliminary go ahead for translunar
injection. We have adequate propellant margins on the Saturn
3rd stage, and despite the some 10 seconds of additional burn
getting into orbit due to the early shut down of the 2nd stage
center engine. It is not expected that the somewhat later
injection time will have any significant affect on the flight
plan; the preliminary time for the beginning of the translunar
injection burn is 2 hours, 35 minutes, 27 seconds - the Flight
Dynamics Officer is in the process now of updating that time but
we don't expect a significant change. At 1 hours, 57 minutes,

controller reports that we've just had acquisition of signal
with the spacecraft from Carnarvon and during this pass flight
controllers will be looking at the spacecraft and the launch
vehicle, the S-IVB one last time before translunar injection.

The crew is rather quiet at this time pre-
paring for that translunar injection burn. The burn again
scheduled to begin at 2 hours, 35 minutes, 44 seconds. The
preducted duration of the burn is 5 minutes, 47 seconds and
we expect that the spacecraft and S-IVB will accelerate some
10, 417 feet per second as a result of that maneuver. We will
not get data from the burn and we'll be out of acquisition with
the spacecraft at the time the maneuver occurs at three Aria
aircraft, Apollo range instrumented aircraft, are stationed
in the ground track off the coast of Australia underneath the
point on earth where translunar injection burn will be
occurring. They will be recording data from it which we
could play back somewhat later if necessary. The booster
engineers just reported that the S-IVB chilldown in preparation
for the burn has begun.

This is Mission Control, we're now at 2 hours,
54 minutes with the crew, and preparing for the CSM separation
from the S-IVB; the subsequent docking with the lunar module
and the ejection of the LM and command module from the
Saturn third stage. And the times of all those events are almost
as precisely as indicated in the flight plan. The separation
maneuver scheduled to occur at ground elapsed time of 3 hours,
6 minutes, 37 seconds; and the docking would come then with
the LM at 3 hours, 16 minutes ground elapsed time. Our dis-
plays in Mission Control are showing the effects of the trans-
lunar injection burn, we currently show the spacecraft at an
altitude of 1183 nautical miles, traveling at a velocity of
31 406 feet per second.

the propulsive vent of liquid oxygen through the engine
nozzle of the S-IVB. The Saturn instrument unit will command
this maneuver or command the lox dump and the lox will blow
out the engine bell for 48 seconds or until the tank is empty
whichever comes first. The preliminary plan would be for the
lox dump to produce a change in velocity of about 28 feet per
second which would contribute to the trajectory change placing
the S-IVB on an impacting trajectory with the moon and sub-
sequent midcourse corrections using the two 70-pound thrust
auxiliary propulsion system units on the S-IVB would be
intended to correct this trajectory and bring it into the
precisely preplanned limits.

This is Apollo Control, Houston, at
4 hours 58 minutes. During the press conference the liquid
oxygen propulsive vent from the S-IVB was completed
successfully. We also had an exchange with the crew during
which Jack Swigart and Fred Haise reported noticing what
appeared to be contrails coming from the S-IVB and we
advised them that this was a normal occurance and during
the propulsive vent from the S-IVB. The plan was to dump
the liquid oxygen for a total of 48 seconds or until the
tank went dry. As it turned out, the tank did not go dry
at the end of 48 seconds and the instrument unit, as planned,
shut the vent off. Now this meant, then, that we continued
to get non propulsive venting which produced the apparent
con-trails viewed by the crew. We have a scheduled mid-course
correction opportunity for the S-IVB at six hours. It is
expected that this mid-course correction will be required
and we also have an opportunity at 9 hours for additional
mid-course correction on the S-IVB to assure that it is on
a trajectory that will impact the moon, at the desired
point. We'll play back for you now, the taped conversations
with the crew, and I'll continue to stand-by for any live
communications with the spacecraft.
SC
Alright, Houston, 13.
CAP COM
13, Houston, go ahead.
SC
Is the S-IVB doing something different?
CAP COM Well, I don't know. It should be, it
should have started the LOX dump quite a while ago. I
quess that's complete. Why do you ask that?
SC
I'm looking out window 5 at what I
think is the S-IVB and I'm seeing what looks to be double
plumes, drawing in two very narrow bands maybe about
three degrees streaming out from it. And then there is
a less dense band that covers, maybe a forty degree swath
through the sky that continues out also, in two directions.
SC
Joe, what it looks like, kind of, if
you pull up behind a guy that's pulling a contrail, if
you get in his contrail, like if he's going away from
you, if it is a long contrail.
CAP COM Okay, stand by. Let me see what Hank's
got to say about that.

Except we're between it, looks like we're
between two contrails. One guy above and one below.

It's a very pretty sight.
CAP COM Ok ay 13, Houston. The booster says that
the propulsive dump is concluded and he now has the non
propulsive vents open and what you see is a normal
phenomenom and should go on for another five minutes or SO.

This is Apollo Control at 5 hours, 16 minutes.
This is a relatively quiet period in the flight plan. We'd
like to take this opportunity to replay a tape recording of
remarks made today by Vice-President Spiro Agnew and West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt at the Kennedy Launch Control
Center following today's liftoff. A communications failure
at the Cape prevented release of a large part of these remarks
during the time they were delivered. We understand the total
tape is about 10 minutes of duration. We'll play that for you
now.
PAINE
It is a great pleasure to introduce the Vice-
President of the United States.
AGNEW Thank you. (Applause). Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Dr. Paine, Mr. Chancellor, Ladies and
Gentlemen of NASA. I feel like a real veteran today. This is
my first - my fifty, excuse me, Apollo launch. No matter how
many I see, they all impress me. It's an overpowering step.
You can't really get used to the - seeing that rocket when you
sit there and you've had a few minutes to reflect on what's gone
into it and how many people are giving SO much of their attention
and energy to the preparation of the shot. You can't help but be
tremendously impressed successively with each shot. Today,
we are honored to have with us Chanecllor Willy Brandt of
the Federal Republic of Germany. I can only say to the
Chancellor that men of his country have given much to the
science of rocketry. Certainly our own people here, people
like Werhner Von Braun and Kurt Debus bearing those names are
testimony enough to the scientific accomplishment of the German
people. But the thing that makes these shots very impressive is
that they are not restricted to what people want, as far as the
sense of accomplishment is concerned. I have had nearly every-
one I talked to connected with the NASA program point out
repetively that it is more important to them that the people
who are doing these things, that the men who are executing the
design that has been conceived and nutured by SO many people.
So many people here in the NASA program that have never set
foot inside a capsule. These people have really brought the
program into being and everyone who I have ever talked to is
of the opinion that the important thing about the program is
that these are human beings, fellow travelers on the planet
Earth who are accomplishing these wonderful things that would
have been considered comic strip material just a few years
ago. Obviously what is taking place in the world of accomplish-
ment depends upon the caliber and devotion of the people in
the NASA program, thousands of people such as yourselves who

had such serious responsibilities in techno-
logical and scientific sense who must put out the product
that makes these flights possible and to you, on behalf of
the President and, of course, myself and all of our people in
Washington, I extend my very sincere congratulations to
another successful mission. I am delighted that I have been
privileged as Chairman of the Space Council to participate
vicariously in your accomplishments. I want to say that I
am very fortunate to have in Bill Anders, a former astronaut,
as the Executive Director of the Space Council, a person who
keeps me very well abreast on what's going on. As we move
to the future, we must consider the all inspiring task of
sorting out our national priorities. One thing is certain.
A program which has been as successful, as efficient, as
economical as this program has been must be carried forward
and the spillover in useable data that can be applied to the
betterment and the comfort and the culmination of man to improve
his destiny is probably greater in this program than anything
that we have ever turned our national attention to, and I can
assure you that we appreciate that very much. Again, it is
a pleasure to be with you and congratulations again on an
outstanding accomplishment. (Applause).
PAINE
(garble) of West Germany.
BRANDT Thank you, very much. Mr. President, I
just wanted to say that I feel honored and deeply grateful
to have been invited to the launching of Apollo 13 and to
have this opportunity, not only to extend my personal good
wishes for a successful journey to the astronauts, but also
to congratulate all those of you, those who are here and many
others in this great country who have prepared and are actually
involved in this project. This is already the fifth time
that men are about to leave, have left, as a matter of fact,
for the moon but it is for that no less fearing an under-
taking and no less exciting for anyone who had the privilage
of watching it. In Germany and I am sure in all of Europe,
people will follow this trip with the same keen interest,
the same emotions as everybody in the United States.
You here, together with all your colleagues can feel a
(garble) for all mankind. On behalf of all my countrymen I
wish that this not only will be a successful trip and a safe
return but further progress for all mankind. Thank you very
much. (Applause).

Our booster systems engineers just reported that the first
midcourse correction opportunity with the S-IVB, the midcourse
correction designed to put the S-IVB on the proper impacting
trajectory with the moon will be required and it is expected
that this maneuver will be a 217 second burn of the two
auxiliary proportion system modules on the S-IVB. These
modules each produce 70 pounds of thrust for a total thrust
of 140 pounds. The booster engineer also reported that it
would probably be required to utilize the second S-IVB midcourse
correction opportunity at 9 hours to assure the proper trajectory.
Midcourse correction 1 for the spacecraft, the command and
service modules is not expected to be needed. The first
midcourse correction opportunity which we would anticipate
the possibility of having to make a small midcourse correction
would be for midcourse correction number 2 at the scheduled
time in the flight plan. At 5 hours, 47 minutes, this is

will utilize the auxiliary propulsion units on the Saturn
third stage. Each producing 70 pounds of thrust for a
total thrust of 140 pounds. The maneuver will be commanded
by the Saturn instrument unit. And is scheduled to have
a total Delta velocity, change in velocity, of about 29.7
feet per second. The burn duration planned for 217 seconds.
This maneuver will, is targeted to impact the S-IVB on the
lunar surface at longitude and latitude of about 3 degrees

Griffin has been taking status reports from each of his
flight controlers. Every one reports, all spacecraft systems
looking good. The Flight Surgeon reports the bio-medical
instrumentation looks excellent, very clean data. He
thinks that, when this crew completes this long day, they
will be tired and will get a good night's sleep. They
have about another six and a half hours before bed-time,
today. Booster systems engineer reports the S-IVB has
been saved, retaining attitude control and mid-course
capability, but that all pressure spheres have been dumped.
He also reports to the Flight Director, that the second
mid course correction of the S-IVB may be later than ground
elapsed time of nine hours. He wants to get a good tracking
vector to use for this final maneuver and he's not quite
sure whether he'll do the maneuver at nine hours or a little
bit later after he refines his tracking data. He reports
the S-IVB still has 372 seconds of burn time remaining,
plus enough fuel in the APS after that to maintain attitude
until 12 hours elapsed time. The guidance officer is
watching Command Module Pilot Jack Swigart perform such
lunar navigation tasks. Through telemetry, he's monitoring
Swigart's markings stars with the sextant, he's very
complimentary of Swigart's ability in this task. On his

"disable quads A and B" so that's all fine. However, going
down now to step 7 where it says "enable all jets" we hoped
you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled there.
In that case, it's as written. All jets should be enable.

out and says enable couples on all axis. So what we'll do is
we'll re-establish this thing and come down to that step 7
then we'll enable all jets. That means enable quads A and B.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 8 hours, 51 min-
utes. Tracking of the S-IVB since its first midcourse
correction indicates that a second midcourse correction
will not be necessary. I repeat; a second midcourse
correction of the S-IVB trajectory will not be necessary,
based on tracking to date since the first midcourse correc-
tion. The booster systems engineers plan to wait until
about 10 hours elapsed time before making a final decision
on whether to perform a midcourse. They want to get further
tracking data from some other stations, and will have it
by that time. The present indications are that the S-IVB
is on the proper trajectory to impact the Moon at the
planned impact point, and a booster has come up with a time
based on present indications, a prediction that the impact
will take place at 77 hours, 49 minutes, 23 seconds. He
says he will update this time later, but that's the pre-
diction at the present time. His studies all show that
capability to command the midcourse will exist until an
elapsed time of 13 hours, 48 minutes. Capability to command
attitude control will exist to the same elapsed time 13 hours,
48 minutes. And, we at present have capability to track
the S-IVB until an elapsed time of 84 hours, 42 minutes
which is well past the predicted impact time. Apollo 13's
altitude now 43 653 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity
9069 feet per second.

CAP COM
Apollo 13, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM Jim, Houston here. Two items, first of all
your PTC is looking very good and should carry you through
the night; second point, have a procedure to give you, if you
are ready to copy, we'd like to set three bits in the computer
and I will explain why.
SC
Go ahead, Vance, we are ready to copy.
CAPCOM Okay. The procedure is as follows: VERB 25,
NO UN 07 ENTER 1331 ENTER, 7 ENTER and ENTER. Explanation is
as follows. During the P23's there was one time when VE RB 37
was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the
optics 0 zero switch was switched to zero. This is a very
uncommon anomaly in that if you do this during a point of
four-tenths of a second interval at around 16 seconds after
you zero the optics so OPT bits are reset and this would mean
that if you had a OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated so all
this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again
where they should be.
SC
Okay, Vance, and I guess I will try to be
slower on that VERB 37.
CAP COM Yes. Slower or faster, either one, I guess.
Well, yes, slower. It is a very unusual thing to have that
happen.
SC
Okay, Houston, stand by for a mark on another
picture.
CAP COM

Roger, we copy, Fred.
SC
Okay, Vance, we've completed that procedure
and let me know if everything is okay.
CAP COM Okay, thank you. We will let you know if
anything isn't okay. I'm sure it is good now.
SC
Tell G&C and GUIDO thanks a lot for keeping
good track of me there.
CAPCOM Roger. They are right on the ball. And,
13, Houston, if you would like, we can let you know about
every two minutes before the earth should be coming into your
window. We think we've got it pegged down pretty well now.
You won't have to look for it so much. You want that?
SC
Yes. That would be fine, Vance.
CAP COM Okay. And, 13, Houston, GUIDO says the bits
are reset, rather are set.
SC
Okay, thanks much.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 9 hours, 32 minutes.
The booster systems engineer has just advised Flight Director
Jerry Griffin that he and his group are going to pack it up
and move out, meaning that no midcourse correction NO. 2 will
be required for the S-IVB. The midcourse correction No. 1

for the third stage of the booster has placed
it on its trajectory which is calculated to impact at into
the moon at the desired point. Several of the booster people
will stand by and continue to monitor but at this point
everything looks and the majority of the people at that

I see nothing coming up here except to close
the waste stowage vent here in a little while. I was thinking
about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty
soon.
CAP COM Okay, that sounds good Jim. FAO here
would like to request just one more picture before you bed
down, if you don't mind.
SC
Okay, we'll come through with one more
picture.
CAP COM
Okay.
CAPCOM
Apollo 13, Houston.
SC
Go ahead Houston.
CAP COM A couple of items Jim. The first is
the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. If you
turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're
concerned down here to close it before that time just before
you go to bed. The second point, we have some results on the
P23's and if Jack's interested we could give him the corrected
altitudes we're getting in S O far.
SWIGERT Yes. I sure am man.
CAP COM Okay. This is preliminary results, but
it will give you some indication. Corrected altitude is turning
out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers, and the fact that
it's plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that you're being
very consistent in judging the altitude. The effective
altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers.
Comments are that, as I said before, you're being consistent
on the horizon selection. The substellar point air is averaging
15 arc minutes and if you could hold the range to a minimum
you might shoot for 5 arc minutes. That's the only comment
there. Over.
SC
Okay. I will try and do a little better
next time.
CAPCOM
But, they're real satisfactory.
SC
Okay. Thank you Ben.

SC
Yes. Okay, Jack says I can't read the
camera very well. It should be 28 based on our start frame.
CAP COM
Correction to 28.
CAP COM 13, Houston. Understand the number showing
that you read on the camera was 28. Was that affirm?
SC
Yes. The readability of that thing is
like half a the frame one way or the other so, 28 I think
is a good number.
CAPCOM
Okay.

This is Apollo Control at 13 hours 57 minutes.
The White Team lead by Flight Director Gene Kranz is in the
process of taking over here in the Control Center releaving
the Gold Team, led by Jerry Griffin. Apollo 13 is 66 738
nautical miles from earth, velocity 7 123 feet per second.
We had no conversation with the crew for the past hour. They
have started a 10 hour rest period. It's a fairly quiet
shift. At the beginning of the shift the crew was performing
program point 3, sis lunar navigation, taking star markings
with the sextant. That went very well. They established
a passive thermal control mode and had to reestablish it
a little bit later as the initial PTC was not well established.
It has been performing very well since it was reestablished.
For a period of several hours the Apollo 13 crew photographed
the earth's weather. One photograph every 20 minutes. Mid-
course correction number 1 was not performed by the space-
craft. Midcourse correction number 1 for the S-IVB, the
third stage of the booster, was performed just prior to the
Gold Team coming on shift this evening at 6 hours elapsed
time. Midcourse correction number 2 was scheduled for 9 hours.
However, tracking determined that midcourse correction number
2 for the S-IVB was not required. And the S-IVB is expected
to impact the lunar surface in the area that is desired at
about 77 hours 49 minutes. The impact time will continue
to be updated throughout the translunar coast period. Prior
to saying good night to the crew we did have a report from
spacecraft commander Jim Lovell that the crew had taken no
medication thus far in the mission. And we reported to the
crew that all spacecraft consumables are in good shape.

from earth of 68 941 nautical miles. The white team of flight
controlers have settled into their respective console positions.
The atmosphere in Mission Control, at the present time, could
be described as quiet, businesslike, since the crew entered
in their rest period some hour and a half to two hours ago.
Flight director Gene Kranz, as is traditionally done, went
around the room talking to each member of his flight control
team, following their change over. Jack Lousma is presently
filling the position of capsule communicator, however, we would
not expect to hear from Mr. Lousma, assuming that the mission
continues on its present flight plan. The report from
flight surgeon during this around the room period indicated
- the flight surgeon indicated that he felt all 3 crewmen
were settled in and sleeping at the present time. He is
recording data on the lunar module pilot, and his data indicated

23 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13. Our digital
displays presently show the Apollo 13 spacecraft at 79 919
nautical miles away from earth. And travelling at a velocity
of 6350 feet per second. We've had no voice communications
or contact with Apollo 13 crewmen Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert,
or Fred Haise, since they started their rest period. Me an-
while, this has provided a period of quiet planning in the
mission control center. One of the items being planned,
midcourse correction number 2, will pass along preliminary
planning numbers for you know. We're presently looking at
a ground elapsed time of 30 hours 40 minutes 57 seconds for
MCC 2, with a DELTA-V or a velocity of 23 feet per second.
This, of course, will be performed with the service propulsion
system of the command module and with a burn duration now
planned of 3.25 seconds. Of course, these numbers will be
reviewed and updated as the mission progresses. We're now
at 17 hours 25 minutes into the flight of Apollo 13 and this

SC
Hello Houston, Houston, hello. 13. Over.
CAP COM
Good morning 13; this is Houston. How
are you?
SC
We feel right in there. We had a fairly
good night's sleep.
CAP COM Okay - real fine. At your leisure, you
can give us radiation reports I guess, and we are getting
a consumables update together for you, and a few other little
details when you are ready to talk. About the only major
thing on the spacecraft is that it is - farther away.
SC
Okay, well, that's to be expected I
guess.
CAP COM
Yeah.
SC
And we're starting to charge battery A.
CAP COM
Rog on battery A Fred. Eecom said battery
B looks real good.
SC
Okay.
SC
Houston.
CAP COM
Go ahead.
SC
Okay, for information, Fred was on comm
last night; and he was over in the left hand seat, and if
you want radiation readings, we - I guess goofed - we left
them all in the suits which are now nicely tucked away.
We are going to get out jack' S suit in an hour or so anyway,
and we'll get his dosimeter out if you wanted to get the
reading on that one.
CAPCOM
Okay, that will be satisfactory.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
And in exchange, the head surgeon would
like to have a rough number of hours each one of your slept
and a qualitative verb to describe it, whether it was good,
fair, or poor.

little while. And I have a small flight plan update for you
sometime a little later on. When you're ready to copy. There's
no big deals in it.

CAPCOM And 13, Houston. We'd like to verify that you
cycled the 02 cryo fans. We s aw the H2, but we didn't see the
02 get stirred up.
SC
Yes Joe, we did, and it kind of looked like we
might have had a little stratification occur right after we put
them on we had a cryo press light.
CAP COM Okay. ECOM told me that this might happen and
he was right.
SC
Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy a flight plan
update and your consumables.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. The Flight Plan update has a couple
of items in it, and the first one we'd like to do is to update
the TFM values in the GNC check list page G9-2. These are
fairly small changes, but in case you need them we'd like you
to have the exact numbers. Over.
SC
Okay. Just a minute. I'll get it out of here.
Joe was that the GNC checklist G9-2?
CAP COM That's affirmative. GNC, page G9-2.
SC
Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. On that page on line 04, column B. Change
the number from 03366 to 05253. Over.

CAP COM
Okay, and line 05, column B, change from 11000 to
33661. Over.

CAP COM Okay. That's right. The only other thing I've
got for you Jack is 3 additional questions for the booster
systems debriefing, which is to take place at about 25 hours,
and we thought we'd pass these questions up to you early SO you
can consider them. Over.
SC
Okay. We're ready to copy.
CAP COM Okay. The first question is and let me get the
original question because This question says "More specifically
on item 2 and Item 2 says, Were there any significant changes
in the noise vibration level during the single stage of powered

during the early S2 center engine cutoff, and approximately
90 seconds prior to TLI cutoff you reported a high vibration
in the S4B. We'd like you to describe the buildup of this
vibration and its behavior through cutoff. Over.
SC
Okay. Initially, what you would like us to talk
about is vibration sequence during the early S2 cutoff of the
center engine and also describe the vibration that we encountered
during the S4B TLI burn? is that correct?
CAPCOM That's it. Okay. The second extra question
is for you, Jim, and it says, Comparing this flight with your
ride on Apollo 8, were there any significant differences in
the powered flight environment?
SC
Okay we'll describe a comparison with

CAP COM Roger, and the last additional question is
what did the ordeal ball look like during TLI? You know, we
passed you an update to that setting and we'd like to know
whether it was right and right on zero or what during the
burn. Over.
SC
Okay, will do, we'll (garbled)

87 percent. Over.
SC
Okay, Joe, we got all those, and how do we
compare them with where we should be in the time line?

slightly ahead of nominal in both those areas.
SC
Okay, okay, Joe, fine.

hold off a little bit on that and I want to make a request to
FAO, if he would sometime during the day when we get a flight
plan update with those activities we agreed to make optional
during lunar orbit and the few activities we were going to
delete. I think that I forgot and left that card back, during
the (garbled) suiting I left it in the suit room.

This is Apollo Control continuing to monitor
the air/ground from Apollo 13. Crew now in breakfast period.
About an hour from now the launch vehicle's systems performance
debriefing will be carried out between the crew of
Apollo 13 and the flight controllers here in the Mission
Control room. Additional questions over the ones that were
preplanned and included in the flight plan will be passed
to the crew from the booster systems engineer. The
philosophy being that many of the debriefing items can be
carried on in flight during rather quiet periods of the
coast phases of the flight. And thereby reduce the amount
of debriefing done after recovery. Spacecraft now 102 342
nautical miles out from earth; velocity now 5345 feet per
second. Ground elapsed time now 24 hours 5 minutes. Apollo
Control continuing to stay alive in anticipation of the
morning news being read up by spacecraft communicator Joe
Kerwin to the crew and a rather quiet day all in all.
Coming up at 30 hours and 40 minutes with midcourse correction
burn number 2 which is the hybrid transfer maneuver to take
the spacecraft out of the free return trajectory and place
it in a nonfree return. But still within the capability of the
propulsion systems of the spacecraft to get back onto the
prereturn. Pericynthion should this maneuver not be made
would be 252 nautical miles above the moon. Post burn it's
more in the neighborhood of 60.2 nautical miles if the
maneuver is done on time and with the desired velocity
change. 24 hours 6 minutes continuing to standby.

Roger; we're thinking together. Waiting
for your call.

Jim but I think its getting better - we are ready for the
launch vehicle systems debriefing whenever you are.
SC
Okay, Houston, Apollo 13. You were cut
out again; repeat please.
CAP COM Roger Jim. We are ready for the launch
vehicle systems debriefing whenever you are.
SC
Okay; just a moment.
SC
Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to question
1, the changes in noise level occurred mainly between the first
stage and the other stages - the other stages were about the
same in noise level during climbing, the first stage of course
made quite a bit of noise in the beginning which built up during
the high Q, and went quiet just after high Q.
CAP COM Okay, copied that Jim.
SC
I might mention that the noise level during
the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all.
CAP COM Roger. And I assume that comm was okay.
SC
That's affirm. Comm was very good all
during the entire flight, much better than expected.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Now in answer to question 2, there was of course
a vibration transient during the second stage that - due to the
number 5 engine going up, which occured shortly before the engine
went out and shortly after that the S2 stage was very smooth.
CAPCOM Okay, Jim. I guess the significant point there
is that you did notice the vibration before you saw the engine
light.
SC
That's right. We noticed the vibration
but it wasn't such that we thought that something catastrophic
was going to happen, it just started vibration and then the
EM light came on, and then the vibration went away and the stage
itself was smooth.
CAP COM
Okay, copied that.
SC
It was all pretty short span just a
second or so before and like a second afterwards, Joe.
And on the S-IVB, the vibration of the vehicle itself was not
the same as during it's powered flight a very high frequency
vibration.
CAP COM That was was that just during TLI, or did you
notice that at insertion?
SC
Well there was a high freqencey vibration
but more noticeable during the TLI burn than it was during the
boost phase.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-12-70 CST 2:23P GET 25:10:36 77/2

I guess the SIVB vibration during TLI
was there all the time although it seemed to grow to us as
the burn progressed, although that may have been just due to
the weight decrease.
CAP COM Okay, you called us about 3 and a half
minutes, but I guess the thing was slowly building up through-
out the whole burn.
SC
That's right.
CAP COM
Okay, was it uncomfortable or did it
cause your vision to degrade or anything like that?
SC
No, not uncomfortable at all and in recalling
the ride on 8, and the S-IVB was much more smooth than even
it was in 13.
CAP COM Copied that.
SC
Okay, now, in answer to number 3, we
did not experience any unexpected transients except all of
us noticed the PU shift, we thought it was more pronounced
than we had expected it to be.
CAPCOM Okay.

look at the thermal shroud and the IU after taking the LM
away and from our viewpoints the shroud was pretty intact. We
saw no loose particles or (garble)
CAP COM Okay, Jim. Understand.
SC
And I guess the answer to 5. I don't think at
any time do we have any degradation problem during power
burn.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
And as for 6. The answer is essentially no.
We don't know of any noticeable (garble).
CAP COM Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the
non propulsive venting on the S-IVB after the APS maneuver
and we copied that at the time.
SC
Okay. That's all. Yeah, we had already talked
about that Joe. It was also visible when it - course it
did it, the course of the basic maneuver, we were looking at
it. Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the S-IVB it was when
(garble) and then later on we saw a particle or something
out there and it might have been the booster or one of the
SLA panels.
CAP COM Yes. When was that Jim?
SC
We're debating. It was somewhere between say
something like 7:30 and 9 hours.
CAP COM Okay.
SC
But, Joe, assuming the S-IVB is still stable.
The object I was looking at was definitely tumbling.
CAP COM Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then,
although it's tumbling now.
SC
It probably was the SLA panel we picked up.
CAPCOM
Right.
CAP COM
Incidently, I guess the guys -
SC
I think (garble)
CAPCOM
Go ahead Jim.
SC
I think we answered number 9. At around 5:32
I think was when we - I think number 5 light came on the
S-2, and a definite vibration which was more than just a
light vibration from the normal S-4 burn and as the light came
on I followed the echo thinking at the time that it was 7:42

--- PAGE 107 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-12-70 CST 2:29P GET 25:16:40 78/2
SC
- and looked up at the time and realized it was
early and when the light came on and the vibration stopped
and the engine of the booster smoothed down and it was very
smooth from there on.
CAP COM Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do
you have any idea what the frequency of it was?
SC
Only to say that it was much higher. I couldn't
say now. It was rather rapid longitudional vibration.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. (Garble)

CAP COM 13, Houston. I read you. We still have
quite a bit of noise on the loop.
SC
I'll standby. Roger.
CAP COM
Okay, Jim. It should be pretty good now.
We copied you answering question number 9.
SC
Do you want anymore comments on the SIV-B
vibrations?
CAP COM I don't think SO. When you get all done,
I'll make a quick check to see if the booster people have
any additional questions. You skipped number 8, Jim, could
you go back to that for a second?
SC
Okay, standby.
SC
Our only comment there, Joe, was that the
burn on TLI to our knowledge was about 3 and three quarters
seconds longer than had been predicted and that was the only
thing that we really noticed; otherwise looked like TLI
was nominal at cutoff.
CAP COM
Okay, understood.
SC
Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to
Apollo 8, liftoff was about the same, the amount of vibration
as I noted on 8 at the beginning of the flight there was less
of the sideways motion than we experienced on Apollo 8. The
SI-C separation felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8
maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I don't
know. There was about 3 sharp transients of the cutoff and
a couple of big bangs where we were thrown backwards
longitudinally on our straps just before the S-2 went off.
And the S-2 was of course just as smooth on 13 as 8 except
when the number 5 engine and we do not experience the
vibration that we experienced on 8 towards the end of the
S-2 burn. And the SIV-B was ... had more vibration than
on 8.
CAP COM Okay, Jim, got all that.
SC
The update on the ordeal ball was a good one.
At the burn we were about just about 8 degrees and we
had to pitch down. The yaw was right on all the way through
the entire burn and just towards the end of the burn the
ball started going (garbled) and pitch a little bit.
CAP COM Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash
a gold star now. Okay, Jim, standby one while I see if we
have any extra questions. Jim, while we're waiting to see
if they have any more questions, I'd like to read you the
booster peoples preliminary analysis on the S-2 cutoff.
Over.
SC
That'd be very interesting go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, preliminary analysis of the data
indicates that the center S-2 engine vibrated at a somewhat
higher amplitude than we've seen on previous flights and
it started at about a hundred and sixty seconds into the

--- PAGE 109 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-12-70 CST 2:35P GET 25:22:25 79/2
CAPCOM S-2 burn. As a result of these vibrations,
the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where
the two low level thrust sensors, thrust location sensors,
initiated center engine cutoff. Early evaluation of data
indicates that no damage occurred to the engine and the
cause of the increased vibration amplitude is still under
investigation. Over.
SC
Okay, it was the center engine.
CAP COM
Yes, right.
SC
Joe, do you have any word on what marks
we had for TLI?
CAP COM At the time of TLI, as I recall, you had
6 seconds longer than a nominal burn which was 3 seconds
longer than the 3 signal low burn.
END OF TAPE

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-12-70 CST 2:41P GET 25:28:15 80/1
CAP COM the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer
than the 3 sigma low burn and you were also GO for a second
opportunity TLI if we required one.
SC
Okay, we were just wondering because it
appeared to us that we had a longer TLI burn than had been
(garbled)
CAP COM Yes, you did. We confirmed that cutoff
time just about as you saw it and I don't have an explanation
for it, but it was with the 3 sigma margin.

Okay, Joe. Out window five I just
picked up the tumbling object again SO for sure it
must have been a SLA panel. I don't think we can still e
in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.
CAP COM I don't think SO Fred. It's several
hundred miles aft of you. Seven hundred miles is the
number, I'm told, and since the SLA panel didn't make the
mid course correction, that might be it.
SC
Yes, it's, I can't really tell for sure
even through the binocular what it is but it looks in the
same relative position to the stars. The best I can tell
about the same intensity and still about the same distance
from us.
CAP COM Can you see it tumbling. Does it have
a shape or is it a point?
SC
No. I can tell it's tumbling, I guess
the flat side not only facing me, not only much brighter
it's also it grows larger.
CAP COM Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if
we can figure out where that's at relative to you. They
keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit. The last
guess we had was that it will impact about the same
longitude we gave you but close to zero lattitude and a
little bit later. You still won't be able to see it.
And they're saying it might make a -
SC
Roger.
CAPCOM They're saying it might make a 100 to
120 foot crater too.
SC
Well, we'll still be past the
terminator (garbled)
CAP COM Roger, right it will be at about the
Rev 20 terminator so, it will be late, late in your lunar
orbit activities before you will be able to photograph it

catsup but I guess we'll overlook that.

information and the second one also for information is that
you're targeted pericynthion is 60 miles after this
correction.

Okay, I understand. For Jack's infor-
mation the EMS DELTA V bias is 3.4 and targeted pericynthion
after this maneuver is 60 miles.

I guess that wasn't too much for a push there,
Vance. I didn't see the accelerometer do a whole lot. It's
a little suprisingly how slowly the injector valves opened,
at least on the indicators.

CAP COM Roger. That was a very short burn.
Request you give us a sweep across the panel when you get
a chance Fred. Let us see Jack and Jim again. Over.
SC
Okay. Okay Vance, I was going to show,
wondering if the folks down there might be interested in
how we find out how far we're away from the moon. Going to
do that right now in program 21 here.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
I'm asking the computer how far away
we are. And the computer is telling me, we're 121 490
miles out.
CAP COM Okay. That agrees rather closely with
our map on the wall.
SC
I'm glad. That means you're tracking
us too. Vance, and if you didn't see our residuals
it was 1/10th X, 2/10ths on Y and 1/10 th Z and double DC was
minus 3.8.
CAP COM Jack, Houston. We show you down here
121 miles 520 up so I quess we all agree.
SC
Okay. Real good, Vance. What I'm going
to do is give you a shot of Fred. If we can get all the
wiring out of the way. The big problem here is when you
move the TV around this wire follows you like a snake here.
CAP COM Yes, we have Fred now. Looks like he
has a lariat there, getting ready to rope the checklist.
SC
That's only half of it. We have most
of it hidden away. It's been pretty interesting doing all
the camera work here to get a little extra training running
the TV here, hopefully for when we get on the ground at
Fra Mauro. The monitor does make it pretty easy though.
CAP COM Right. That's a real advantage in the
cockpit. You're just a little bit dark. It looks like it
might help to have the F-stops run down about one increment.
See how it comes out.
SC
I think we're wide open. Yes, we're
wide open, Vance.
SC
Okay, does that help any Vance?
CAP COM Okay, it's reasonably good. We can
make out Fred fairly well. Looks like he's in a shadow.
Hey, that helps. You just turned up the lights, huh?
SC
Yes, we went fixed on the -
CAP COM
Okay. You're on candid camera.
SC
We did notice one thing, Vance. You
know that new fad with long hair? It won't work too well up
here in space.
CAPCOM
What was that one again?
SC
I said, you know the new, the new fad
with long hair?
CAP COM
Right.
SC
It doesn't work too well in space, you
can't comb your hair up here.

--- PAGE 131 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-12-70 CST 7:56P GET 30:44:00 94/2
CAP COM Well, I guess you have to give up
something.
CAP COM Well, at least it helps to try. We can see
you trying to comb your hair there Jim. It looks like your
beards haven't come along to the point where you've had to
use the razor though.
SC
Well, we've been debating that. We
thought we'd take care of our beards tomorrow and make that
one of our daily routines. I take it that was a subtle
hint Vance.
CAP COM No, we're not commenting on your appearance
Fred. I mean nothing derrogatory, understand.
SC
And Vance thought we get a picture of
Jack so that all the girls will know that he's still here.
(laughing) Say hello to them.
CAP COM Yes, we, we'd appreciate that. There
he is. Big Jack. Jack, you're in the shadow right now, we
have a little bit of interference from your window which is
bright, we can't, I think your smiling but it's a little
hard to tell.
SC
Think I'm smiling.
CAP COM Hey, there we go. Incidentally, we've
been getting all kinds of bits of information to pass up
to you. We've had baseball scores coming in, basketball.
Somebody said there's 220 days, shopping days left until
Christmas.
SC
Oh. Who won the Masters, Vance?
CAP COM It was a tie for the Masters and
stand by. It was a tie between Littler and Casper after
72 holes and there is going to be a play off Monday, we
understand.
SC
Oh. Sounds good.
CAP COM One thing the world might be interested
in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of
configuring switches back. We heard you go through the
check list. But, I guess right now, basicly, you probably
have all the switches back into position and your in the
mode to continue on with what the flight plans say. You're
going to be doing cis lunar navigation. So, Jack you're
going to be down in the LEB is that correct?
SC
That's right, Vance. I'll be going down
there shortly.
CAP COM Okay, the TV now is all but black. Looks
like it might be pointing into a shadow.
SC
What he's doing there, he's trying to
give you one more shot of the moon and right now I'm setting
to maneuver to the optics calibration attitude.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
What I wanted to point out and I don't
know if it's apparent but we'll show the advantage of

SC
doing all the dumps just before the burn
we're looking again at the same scene over quad one at the
moon and now you don't see all the sparkley growth and
particles out there any more. We've sort of run off and
left them.
CAP COM Rog. We don't see anything out there anymore
in the way of particles leaving the spacecraft. We suggest,
maybe you zoom the moon in some a little bit, again SO we
can see the shape of it better. Okay, that brings the moon
in. We can see the terminator at the top of the melon-shaped
disk.
SC
Okay. Now you can see a few of those sparkling
particles going across the screen. Those are being emmitted
by the thrusters. Jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.
CAP COM Okay. We can see those very poorly. Well,
actually they're coming

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-12-70 CST 8:06P GET 30:54:00 95/1
CAP COM Okay. We can see those very poorly.
Well actually, they are coming in better now. It looks like
little specks going from the upper left part of the screen
across to the right and understand those are from the thrusters.
Capcom Okay, 13, Houston. Just as an item of interest,
advise your speed with respect to the earth is now 4667 feet
per second.
SC
Okay. Thanks, Vance.
CAP COM Okay, Apollo 13, Houston. The moon has been
in and out of our screen here. Right now it's off at the
bottom side, but we can still see the particles coming off the
spacecraft.
SC
Okay, I am going to have to pull it off
the window, Vance, the sun is coming up on the right side.
CAP COM
Roger, understand.
SC
You want to see the sun on the ullage
(garble) ?
CAP COM
Say again.
SC
Do you want to see any of the photographs
or do you want the TV down in the LEB?
CAP COM
Right, Jim. It would be good to see what
you are doing down in the LEB or the far corner of the space-
craft where the optics are. It might be interesting to describe
what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sightings.
SC
Okay, Vance, first we are going to give you a
you a shot of the sleep station.
SC
While Jack is getting the sleep station
rolled up. I thought I would show you one interesting corner.
We have a temporary stowage back here and that's where all our
waste paper and all that goes after every meal. It's in the
right-hand corner down by our dump system.
CAP COM Roger, understand. We are looking at the
waste basket.
SC
The age-old question that is always asked
us is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that line that
you see, I think you can see it now, it goes right outside
where we open up the overboard drain dump and all our waste
products, liquid waste products, go out through that line
and get dumped overboard.
CAP COM Roger, understand and we can see somebody's
foot, as well.
SC
Okay. Fred is now going down there and he
is going to try to get underneath the sleep station on his side
where we have a sleep restraint and the whole object of that is
to merely position the body between the bottom on his side where
we have a sleep restraint and the whole object of that is just
to position the body between the

--- PAGE 134 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-12-70 CST 8:06: GET 30:54:00 95/2
SC
bottom of the spacecraft and and SO it doesn't
float up between that and the bottom of the couch.
CAP COM Roger. The sleep restraint of the hammock
is coming into view underneath the couch. It's a white object.
SC
You perhaps can see the zipper of the
hammock right now. The between the line and that white object.
CAP COM Right. We can see it.
SC
Vance, these hammocks, by the way, are
very comfortable. When we first heard about them in the
design of Apollo, we thought they weren't necessary, but they
turned out to be a very nice device in the station.
SC
I'm trying now to get down there with Fred
to show you how it works. I keep floating up thought but
maybe we can get a little shot here.
CAP COM Okay. We have somebody upside down in the
photograph now. Realizing of course, that in space there is
no really right side up or upside down. It still looks that
way to us.
SC
Okay. That's Fred now. I'm trying to
put him right side up. for you folks down there in the sleep
station. Fred, would you move your hand there back off the
view.
CAP COM Okay. that is coming in real clear, Jim.
We see Fred in the sleeper restraint.
SC
As a matter of fact, Vance, Fred sits
down there all the time.
CAP COM Yes. I can see he appreciates that.
Looks very comfortable. It looks like there is a lot of room
down there considering all the boxes on the floor and under-
neath the couch.
SC
It's surprising but there is quite a bit
of room down there with the Hycon camera box down. On the
way down we'll pick the camera back up.
SC
Okay, Vance, if there is no more that
you would like to see right now, we'll terminate our TV
for you today.
CAP COM Okay. Thanks very much, Jim. Appreciated
seeing it.
SC
Thank you. Good bye.

CAP COM 3-degree rotation rate. Second one -
SC
Okay, copy that.
CAP COM Second one at 32 hours looking at Bennet's
Comet. We want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is
as stable as it's going to be before starting PTC. The stability
requirement is very high. We weren't sure if you understood
that from what we passed up. In addition the photographs
might now show as much as the eye can see of the Comet, so
if you see anything interesting about the structure of the
comet, why sketching it is in order and is encouraged.
SC
Okay, Vance, what we'll do is when we get
to attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we did last
night. We'll let GUIDO and you people down there tell us when
you think we are stable enough, then we'll do all this work
with the dack on the sextant first and then when we get that
done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and
see what we can observe visually.
CAP COM Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you
are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might be inter-
esting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually.
Okay. Next item. Your SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever.
It was a very good burn.
SC
Okay. Very good.
CAP COM Next item request hydrogen tank 1, heater
off for balancing purposes and, Apollo 13, another item,
something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a
slight TCE fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation has
been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37 second period.
It has been seen on other flights in the past. No one is
worried about it but the usual fluctuation is about 1 and
one-half degrees instead of 7 seconds so thought you should be
aware of it.
SC
Okay, Vance. There is one other slight
distinction we noted is that the hydrogen versus the oxygen
is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3.
CAP COM Okay. We copy. The last item we'd like
to send you an IRIG update so at your convenience request
POO and ACCEPT.
SC
Okay. We are in POO and ACCEPT, Vance.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Quad C and D are disabled then.
CAP COM Roger. Disabled. And down here we see
that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly
matched so we suspect it's purely a spacecraft readout problem.
SC
Okay.

At this time the crew is in the process
of stabilizing the spacecraft attitude, eliminating all rotational
rates in preparation for spinning up the spacecraft for the
passive thermal control mode. Before beginning the slow
rotation of passive thermal control, Jack Swigert will attach
the data acquisition camera to the spacecraft's sextant, the
28-power sextant, and will attempt to get some photographs
of Bennet's comet. He'll take a series of photographs at
varying time exposure rates and he's also been advised if
any particularly interesting features are noted visually of
the Comet Bennet, that they should attempt to sketch them.
At present time, Apollo 13 is 125 083 nautical miles from
earth. The spacecraft velocity is 4571 feet per second. The
fuel cell temperature fluctuations which were mentioned are
occurring in fuel cell No. 3 -

- the fuel cell temperature fluctua-
tions which were mentioned are occurring in fuel cell num-
ber 3, and this is a temperature that's measured at the
condenser exhaust, at the point where the hydrogen reactant
is flowing out of the fuel cell and the water's being separated
from it. The other two fuel cells are remaining steady
at about a 157 -
SC
- when you're through with the DSKY's so we can
load down 88?
CAP COM
Roger, we'll let you know, Jack.
PAO
And as we were saying, the two other fuel
cells, Fuel Cells 1 and 2, are remaining stable at a tempera-
ture of about 157 to 159 degrees. Fuel Cell 3 is fluctuating
between about 152 and 160. Vance Brant advised the crew
that this will cause no problem, with a possible exception
that it could trigger a warning alarm to them. But we have
seen this sort of thing on previous flights, and it should
cause no problem.
CAP COM Apollo 13, Houston. The computer's yours
again.
P AO
The Guidance Officer has just reported that
the spacecraft appears to be approaching a stable attitude,
and we expect that would be in a position shortly for the
crew to begin - attempt to photograph the Bennet Comet.
CAP COM
Okay, you're go for the pictures.
SC
Okay, Vance. We tried the auto optics and
couldn't pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much right
into the Sun and things are pretty well washed out. And
I've gone to manual optics and I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5
on the shaft and trunnion and I still can't pick it up. So,
it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think maybe
we're to near the Sun to see it.
SC
That's right, Vance. The sextant is all -
it's - it's all milky and it - any Comet that could be seen
today would just be in the background.
CAP COM Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion.
Standby.
SC
It is the large reflection from the Sun
behind us off the LM; and it is - it is coming on that Quad 1
there, and that Quad is reflecting back into the sextant.
CAP COM Okay, Jack, understand. Just a question:
If you look through the telescope, can you see the the
Comet at all? Over.
SC
No, I can't, Vance. It's it's still too
light. A - ah -
SC
Does that -
CAP COM
Standby.
PAO
This is Apollo Control. You heard Jack
Swigert advise and Jim Lovell confirm, that reflections of
the Sun off the LM are apparently washing out the sextant

- field of view and making it impossible to
get a view of the Bennet - the Comet Bennet. This problem
is being discussed in Mission Control right now. Ken
Mattingly who is in the Control Center, and the Flight Acti-
vities Officier, and CAP COM Vance Brant as well as astronaut
Tony Angeland, are huddled around the Flight Director's
console, discussing the possibility of perhaps seeking another
spacecraft attitude that might avoid the reflection problem.
SC
Say, Vance?
CAP COM
Roger, go ahead.
SC
Are the flowers blooming yet?
CAP COM
Gee, I sure haven't seen any.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
Hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion
down here on your trying to observe the Comet and this
reflection is not unexpected. And give us another minute,
and we'll be back with you on something on that.
SC
Okay, I doubt very seriously, though, if
we take any of these photographs with high speed black and
white, with -

something on that.
SC
Okay. I doubt it very seriously
though. If you take any photographs with high speed Black and
white with the light coming in to the face that you going to get
anything out of it.
CAP COM Okay. Unanimous opinion is that
your right and we'll scratch all of this Bennett's Comet
stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will
be more favorable after TEI. Over.
SC
Sounds good. Without the LM, we
might have a better chance.
CAP COM Rog. And Apollo 13, you're go
for PTC, your rates are very low according to what we can
read.
SC
Rog. Okay , I'll give you a call
on OMNI B, Vance. Do you read, Vance?
CAP COM Roger. Go ahead, request OMNI B
Fred, and secure the high-gain antenna.
SC
Okay, you got it.
CAP COM
Okay.
CAP COM
Apollo 13, Houston.
SC
Go ahead Houston.
CAP COM
Jim. Something to think about.
In about 30 minutes we can generate the pads that we have
yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could support
earlier sleep period if you so desired. But, it will take
us 30 minutes to get that stuff. The other thing is, any
time your ready to copy, I can read up these solo book changes
over. And also, two pages in the flight plan.
SC
Okay, Vance. We're about ready to
copy the solo book changes and the flight plan changes and
whenever your pads are ready we'll take those and as far
as moving up the sleep period, that's fine, but if we don't
go to sleep right away, we'll use it to get out our lunar
maps and study them.
CAP COM Okay, and we'll get busy getting
those pads for you as soon as possible then and I'll stand
by on this copying bit.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 32 hours
46 minutes. The crew sleep period is scheduled to begin
at 37 hours. You heard Vance Brand advise Jim Lovell that
should the crew desire, we would be in a position to give
them the pad information that they need to get before beginning
the sleep period a bit early and if the astronauts themselves
the option of beginning their rest period earlier if they
desire. The primary activities remaining on the flight plan
in addition to passing up those , the numerical data, is
for the crew to change out one of the lithium hydroxide
canisters and complete the pre-sleep checklist and their
evening meal. And when those things have been completed
they would be able to begin the rest period. We don't have
any idea at this time precisely when the rest period would
begin, that would be up to the crew.

P AO
This is Apollo Control at 34 hours 13
minutes. At this time, the crew has very little to complete
before beginning their sleep period. They still had a
Lithium Hydroxide canister to change out. Following that,
we expect they'll begin their eat period, and it's possible
that they will begin the sleep period somewhat earlier than
the scheduled 37 hours in the flight plan. Our latest estimate
on the impact of the S-IVB, the Saturn third stage on the
lunar surface is that this event will occur 77 hours 57
minutes 37 seconds, and our current tracking data indicates
that the impact point will be 0 degress 56 minutes North,
29 degress 33 minutes West. Apollo 13 at this time is
130 736 nautical miles from the Earth travelling at a speed
of 4 402 feet per second.

This is Apollo Control at 34 hours

the spacecraft appears to be remaining quite stable in the
passive thermal control mode. The spacecraft rotating
slowly to maintain the proper thermal balance as the normal
mode for the spacecraft to be in during sleep periods and
periods of low crew activity. Jim Lovell advised some time
ago - a couple of hours ago, that the crew might begin the
sleep period early. He said if they had any problem getting
to sleep or if they weren't particularly sleepy at the time they
finished their other scheduled activities, that they might
review some of their lunar charts before turning in for the
10 hours rest period. At this time Apollo 13 is 131 948
nautical miles from earth, travelling at a speed of 4 368
feet per second. At 34 hours 43 minutes this is Mission

And, Vance. Has FIDO come up with
any observations on the trajectory?
CAP COM Well, a minutes ago he said that
to tell you that he was passified now after your past comments
on his trajectory and so forth and he hasn't seen any waste
water dumps or anything and he's pretty happy.

Okay. I just wondered if we're
going to need any more midcourse.

Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking
about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's
now being talked about a little bit. To be conservative, people
would like to have you read the SHE tank pressure when you go
into the LM for the LM familiarization at 58 hours. If there's
no midcourse 3, and it looks like there's a good chance that
there will not be, why they might want to move the LM familiarization
up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.
SC
Okay. If we don't have a midcourse 3 then we'll
probably move LM fam up to 55 hours in which case we'll go in
there and read SHE tank pressure.
CAP COM Roger. Along with the other fam stuff and it's
not certain that we want to do this, it's just being talked about
so this is just information for you.

Okay. This is beginning to sound like the sim
that we ran not too long ago.

point for the S4B, based on later tracking data. The current
figures predict that the S4B will impact the moon at a Ground
Elapse Time of 77 hours, 56 minutes, 54 seconds, and the
coordinates of the impact are now predicted to be 2 degrees

on all your consumables. On the H2 tank problem, we have a
procedure that we'd like you to carry out which is simply
turning the H2 tank 2 heaters to OFF at this time and we want
to see whether that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure
setting off CAUTION in 01 and we want to look at it that way
for a few hours.

Okay, you want to both H2 and tank 2 off,
is that correct?
CAP COM That's negative, just tank 2. We want
tank 01 to stay in AUTO.

Okay, tank 2 heaters OFF at this time.
CAP COM Okay, good deal. That's been the high
tank and apparently while waiting for that pressure switch to
close to start the heater cycle, the tank 1 pressure has been
dropping. It's been a little lower and just setting off
CAUTION in 1, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2 heater
and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle we won't get into
the CAUTION and WARNING range.

SC
Houston, Apollo 13. I'm about ready for
the flight plan updates that you have.
CAP COM Okay, 13. Starting off with got a minor
procedural change for Jack on his next P52 if he's ready to
listen to that.
SC
Okay, Jack's still off COMM. We'll hold
off on that a little bit and then we'll pick it up so he can
talk now.
CAP COM Okay, fine. I've got 2 updates for you,
Jim. One is a procedure for looking for comet Bennett at
about 49:45 and I'll wait till Jack gets up before passing
you the details on that. The other update is concerned with
going into the LM 3 hours early and I think Vance mentioned to
you last night that this was a possibility, that we'd like to
look at the she-tank pressure early and since we're not going

Okay, right, that's fine with us. We'll
move up LM entry to 55 hours.

All the midcourse stuff including
the P52 which is called out at about 54 and a half and we'll
be slipping that til later, which I'11, which I'll tell,
which I'll tell you in a minute. Okay, then you, we want
to move the battery charge up 3 hours to about 52:30 and
we want to move the moving the LM tunnel vent valve to
LM CM delta P up 3 hours to 52:45, and at that point you
can simply go to the 57 hour point in the flight plan and
change your number from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through
that. In the remarks section at about 57:50 it says 02 fuel
cell purge and waste water dump here if not performed earlier
we want you to do that at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV
cast then, will be at 55 hours or 55:30. We'll go right

SC
We're back with you.
CAP COM
Okay. I've gone through the battery
charge, the LM vent valve, the fuel cell purge and then stop
PTC at 55 hours and your roll attitude there will be 285
degrees, which is per the flight plan. The high-gain antenna
angles are slightly different. Pitch 23 and Yaw 267 degrees.
The TV pass till 55:30, the standard LM activation, except
for some special steps we'll give you to take a look at
C tank pressure which I don't have yet. Restart PTC at about
56:30 or whenever you're through with the LM activities and
after that, at your convenience, we'd like you to - we are
to do the P52 option 3 that we cancelled at 54 and a half
hours. Over.
SC
Okay, that last comment was tha and we'll do the
P52 after we start PTC at about 56:30.
CAP COM That's right. Any time after that.
It's not time critical.
SC
Okay, let's see if I have some
of this, Joe. Around 52:30 we're to do the battery charge
on Battery B.
CAPCOM
That's correct.
SC
And at about 52:40 we're going to
do the LM tunnel vent valve and the LM CM delta P which has
been written up at 55:40.
CAP COM
That's correct.
SC
We're deleting midcourse 3 and we've
moved up LM entry to 55 hours. So we'll merely follow all the
- we'll follow all the procedure that leads up to that entry
that was rescheduled for 58.
CAP COM That's correct. You can start at
57 in the flight plan; call it 54 hours and press right on.

Okay, we're going to start the PTC
for EM entry and ROLL 285 and high gain angles, are PITCH 23 and

the computer is yours.
SC
The computer is ours. We're in

CAP COM You can crank it up sometime prior to
55 hours at your convenience just to set it up. We'll be
expecting transmission at 55 hours.
SC
Okay.
SC
And Houston, Apollo 13. One thing
I missed about the 02 fuel cell purge and waste and water dump.
CAP COM Roger. We'd like the the 02 fuel cell
purge and waste water dump at 54:50.
SC
Roger. We'll pick up those angles
at 54:50.
CAP COM
Apollo 13, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Joe.
CAP COM All right Jack. One thing we'd like
to have done sometime soon is to have you cycle the cryo fans
in 02 tank 2 one more time. We'd like to see if we can get that
sensor back again.
SC
Okay. 02 tank 2 fan on now.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
Hello, Houston. 13.
CAP COM
Go, 13.
SC
We have just 1 question. The LM
panel vent valve. We're a questioning why we're venting it
til Delta P is greater than 1.7 and we're
going to open up the panel, then pressurize the LM usual.
CAP COM Right. Standby on that.
CAP COM
13, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Roger. The word on that, Jim is that
they want to insure the proper 02 concentration in the LM when
you get to the surface, and this is a method of doing that by
bleeding out additional nitrogen.
END OF TAPE

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-13-70 CST 1:10P GET 47:57:20 131/1
CAP COM fit of doing that by bleeding it out
additional nitrogen.
SC
Okay, thank you.
CAP COM
And 13, Houston. If Jack is up I'd like
to talk to him about the P52 briefly.
SC
Okay, he's here.
SC
Go ahead, Joe.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. What they'd like you to do
on this P52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight
jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 2/10th of a degree
plus or minus. Before you come out of the optic zero position,
at the start of this P52 they'd like you to just observe the
shaft readout and see if the jitter occurs on your direct
readout there and also they'd like you to briefly call up a VERB 16
NOUN 91 so we can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.
SC
Okay, let me see if I got it right. On
the P52 at 49 hours, before coming out of zero on the optics
observe the shaft and also call up 16 91 and let you look at
the shaft and trunnion angles to observe a possible jitter to
see whether it occurs in the zero position as well as out of
zero.
CAP COM Roger, Jack, that's correct, and if you
have time now I've got a flight plan update for you on looking
for the comet Bennett.
SC
Okay. Stand by one, Joe, and the commander's
going off the air briefly.
CAP COM
Roger that.
SC
Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy now.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. I'm going to read it to you
and then add some comments and we'll talk about it a little.
This should occur sometime after 49:30. After the P52
realine at 49 hours, if time permits we would like the crew to
investigate while in PTC if there is a roll angle at which
the comet can be observed for photos. If there is, record
the optimum roll angle for possible photography and prior to
reinitiating PTC at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done
in the LM, use P52 planet option and the following half unit
vectors for tracking comet Bennett at about 49:46. Are you
ready to copy half unit vectors? Over.
SC
Okay, go ahead, Joe.
CAP COM
Okay, R1 plus .34202; R2 minus .07374;
R3 plus 35719. Read back.
SC
Okay, copy R1 plus 34202; R2 minus 07374;
R3 plus 35719.
CAP COM Okay, that's correct and the last sentence
on the update is that you can expect AOS of the comet at a
roll of 45 degrees and LOS at a roll of 155 degrees. Now,
the deal here, Jack, according to the plots they've shown me
is the comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from the sun

--- PAGE 183 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 1:10P GET 47:57:20 131/2
CAP COM and due to the geometry of the LM there
shadowing the sun, it would appear that you will be able to see
the comet through the sextant without getting sun shafting
between roll angles of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It
appears that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees, although
the comet is still in the field of view, the sun is also in
the field of view and you probably will not have any success
between 75 and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75. If
you do find that you can see the comet somewhere between
45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note that roll angle and then
if it's feasible we'd like you to photograph it after the
LM entry part of the checklist. Over.
SC
Okay, Joe, let me give it back to you
and see if I've got it here.

SC
Okay Joe. Let me give it back to you
and see if I've got it here. After the P52, during our PTC
you want us to use P52 and observe Bennetts Comet through
the sextant note the roll angle if we can find it visible,
be visible ideal16 between 45 and 75 degrees and we should lose
at it about once every 55 rolls and if we do see it make an
observation of whether it is photographical, note the ROLL angle for
photographs after or prior to initiation of PTC at 5630.

Okay, Jack, we're getting you back, and I
hope you copied my my correction of my mistake I'm talking
about the H2 cryo tanks. We'd like the tank 1 heater to off;
tank 2 to auto. Over.
SC
Okay, we lost you again. Here's our heater
configuration now. H2 heaters 1, off; 2, auto. Both 02
heaters are in auto.
CAP COM Okay, that's the configuration we want you
in and here's what we're thinking about. When we went to
tank 1, auto, tank 2, off; we found that the heater cycle
that a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi which is well above
the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configura-
tion for sleep, we'll keep from getting caution and warning
lights during the sleep cycle. Okay, in order to do that,
comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using
more H2 out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in
favor of tank 1, SO at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all
come out even. And that's why we have you in tank 1, off;
tank 2, auto; now. We expect to get about a 3 percent un-
balance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep we'll call
you to reverse the configuration again.

were sacked out. Over.

and the rationale for it. Over.
SC
Okay, standby.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
(Garble).
SC
Go ahead, Joe.
CAP COM
Okay. Before you start copying, this procedure
is - is basically simply to activate the supercritical helium
pressure gaging so that you can read it. And -
SC
No.
CAP COM
- the concern here is lest this supercritical
helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours, at which point
we'd be within a possibility of rupturing a burst disk, when
you activate the DPS. Now, based on the pressure at launch,
and based on a nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi per
hour, between then and now, the pressure should read about
710 psi. Standby.
SC
Houston, you were cut out. Would you say again
about the helium pressure.
CAP COM Roger. Based on the prelaunch pressure in
the S CH tank and the nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi
per hour the pressure should be about 710 at 55 hours. Are
you reading, over?

Jim, Houston. Did you read that last?

Okay, Joe. I'm on OMNI C, now. How do you
read?

You're still loud and clear on - on D, Fred.
Standby one.
SC
Okay, I'll put her back to OMNI B if you
all want to take command again?
SC
And the last thing we heard Joe, was that
the supercrit should be reading about 710 psi.

--- PAGE 196 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 3:31P Get 50:18 143/2
CAP COM Okay, that's the last thing I passed up, and
while we're waiting for EECO to decide here, let me continue.
The DEADBAND that is considered acceptable is between 660 and
770 psi. In other words, any rise time that'll give you one,
a pressure between those two, will keep you below the
critical pressure at 103 hours or SO. So, we expect it to
read in that - in that band and if it does, there will be
no problem. If it reads between 770 and 800 psi we will
want you to check the pressure again at about 59 hours.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 3:45P GET 50:32:50 144/1
CAP COM - to get PCM data on it for one thing.
We may have to have you sit there and stare at the gauge
for awhile to find out when it clicks up and get an accurate
rise time on it and then in extreme case, we are even thinking
about a ditch burn, but we don't really think that will happen.
Now, if you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a
change or an addition to the LM activation checklist between
pages TLC-1 and TLC-2 which consists of 7 steps and if you
can find a blank side to write it down on, I would like to
pass it up. All right?
SC
We're reading you on OMNI C now.
CAPCOM Okay. You're loud and clear on ONMI C
now. Stand by one while we get ENCO sinked up.
SC
Okay, The rest of your update was that
it's okay if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If
it's above 770, you are going to ask us to consider going
back in at 59 hours. And, either get PCM going or sit there
and give you gauge reading changes on the basis of that.
You said something about an extreme measure, you may have to
consider some sort of dips maneuver.
CAP COM That's correct, Fred. We don't have
procedures for that yet and we don't have any real expectation
of getting into it. The procedure I'd like to read up to you
now is simply the steps required to get the supercritical
helium pressure reading at 55 hours. Over.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. We're calling this page TLC-1-A,
Step 6, Transfer to LM Power.
SC
Stand by one, Joe.

Okay, Joe, I've created a new page here
called TLC-1-A, Item 6, Transfer to LM power and the usual
check that the flood lights blank, caution light, power
light ON, I get a GET from Jack and I will pass that on down
to you. Item 7, Circuit breaker EPS translunar bus tie
panel 11 and 16 closed. Step 8 circuit breaker lighting
and uitlity on panel 1, close and turn on the utility lights
However, the lighting is such that I don't really need those.
They are in stowage right now, I guess, and I probably could
leave them there.

This is Apollo Control, Houston, at
54 hours 42 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 13.
Apollo 13 now shows an altitude of 175 826 nautical miles
and its speed reads 3204 feet per second. Network has been
advised by Goldstone that network does now have the capability
of receiving television at any time. We will stand by in
the event we should receive an early television transmission.
At this point we do not expect to receive such, but we will
stand by at 54 hours, 43 minutes into the flight. This is
Apollo Control, Houston.
SC
Okay, Houston, we've transferred to LM
power, time was 54 hours, 46 minutes and 15 seconds.
CAP COM Got you, Jack. Transferred to LM power.
Thank you.
SC
And the docking tunnel index was minus 2 degrees.
CAP COM
Say again, Fred, you are coming in with
a lot of background noise.
SC
Okay. The docking tunnel index mark
was minus 2 degrees.
CAPCOM
Roger. Minus 2 degrees.
SC
Okay. Jack, how do you read?
CAP COM
Fred, Houston is reading you loud and
clear.
SC
Okay, I've got up to Step 7 now and
not getting much of a light in the helium indicator here.
Why don't I review for you how we proceeded and you look at
the procedure you gave me and see if we've missed anything.
CAP COM Roger. Go ahead.
SC
Okay. We transferred to LM power and
it looked okay. (Garble). Caution and warning lights, all
the red flags, and we got both exlunar buss tie breakers in,
the utility lighting breaker is in, then then AC buss B,
helium PQS display, AC buss B numeric lighting and AC buss B
inverter one, its buss tie is closed. Then I closed the
inverter one breaker and I've selected on panel 16 in the
signal consensor breaker and then I selected inverter one
and put the helium on the switch to supercrit and have no
lights.

Okay, Jack. Hold the phone. They
forgot the reostat was cranked all the way down on the

pretty good number.
CAP COM
Roger, we copy 720.

Ken just flickered down to 710. It's
kind of flickering between 710 and 720.
CAP COM Roger, 710 to 720.
CAP COM Okay, Fred those were good numbers
and we're not going to have to crank up the TM. That's the
number we were looking for.

Back out of this in reverse at least
as far as getting this part of it power down.

Our super critical helium pressure
rating was 720 pounds per square inch. A very desirable
number. We're at 54 hours 53 minutes now into the flight.

standing by now for receipt of television.
PAO
Apollo Control Houston, 54 hours,
55 minutes. We repeat that earlier report from LM pilot
Fred Haise. He read his super critical helium pressure at
720 pounds per square inch. Well under the 770 pounds per
square inch mark earlier identified as a point for further
scrutinization.

Okay, sounds good. We'll have it in
a minute, we're just playing with the high-gain right now.
SC
Okay, Houston. How do you read us with
the high-gain.
CAPCOM
We're hearing you five square, Jim, how me.
SC
Okay. You're coming through okay.
CAPCOM As you were on that Jim. We don't have
you on the high-gain yet. We're still looking at you.
CAP COM 13, Houston. In this attitude we suggest
pitch five, yaw 237 on the high gain, over.

Pitch 5, yaw 237, roger.
PAO
Apollo Control, Houston, 55 hours
05 minutes, continuing to stand by for television transmission.
SC
Can, can you read the high-gain now?
CAP COM Affirmative Jack. We've got you on the
high gain that appears to us that we're on the wide beam
width.
SC
Yes. We can't get it to come down to
narrow. We tried to switch to auto track or REACQ, and
yaw drives around from pitch 70 to 0. And pitch goes from
about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm trying, we're putting it
on manual now at the angles that you gave us and I'll try
to get you in medium and narrow beam with picking it up
manually here.
CAP COM Roger, Jack. Meanwhile, we'll look at
the situation you described there.
SC
Okay. And it does it on both sets of
servo electronic power.
P AO
Apollo Control, Houston, 55 hours 07
minutes. We now show Apollo 13 at 176 598 nautical miles.
SC
Jack, what it looks like is that when
we hit 239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort of
scan limit or something and drops off.
CAP COM Roger, Jack, thank you.
SC
Okay, I'm trying you in wide and medium
beam width now. Can you pick up the TV in this condition
here at all?
CAP COM Negative, Jack. We'll have to have the
narrow beam width.
SC
Okay, can you give us, maybe, a slight
maneuver?
CAP COM Jack, we'd like you to check two high
gain circuit breakers down in panel 25. Check your high
gain group too in your high-gain and flight books. Over.
SC
Okay. Okay, Jack they're both in.
CAP COM Roger. 13, we've got an attitude suggestion
for you. We suggest that you go to roll 285 and try pitch 90
and yaw zero. Over.

SC
Okay.
SC
(Garble) Quads C and D. Roger.
CAP COM
Okay, 13 we've got Fred "0" on TV.
SC
Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you
today is start out in the space shipper Odyssey, and take
you on through from Odyssey in through the tunnel into
Aquarius. And show you a little bit of the landing vehicle,
and your TV operator is now resting on the center couch,
looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now just about at the
beginning of the tunnel, and his back is against the - our
equipment bay optical area. And Fred will now transport
himself into the tunnel, and into the spaceship Aquarius.
SC
Yes, one thing I noted, Jack, when I first
came across there, that starting upright in the command
module and heading down into Aquarius, there's a little
bit of an orientation change that, even though I'd been
through it once, in the water tank, is still pretty unusual.
I find myself now, standing with my head on the floor, when
I get down into the LM.
SC
(Garble).
CAP COM
That's a great picture, Jim. You got the
light just right.
SC
And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly
for a novice like myself is the - the ease of moving around
in here. It's of course, as you know from working in the
command module simulator, it's really quite a boon to have
zero-gravity as an aid. Cause you get - pretty confining
really, at one-g to move around very much in there, and it's
quite easy in this environment.
SC
The LM as you can see it looked pretty clean,
I found a couple of loose washers about it and the - a little
plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and it's
on this lodged over by the ED panels. (Garble).
SC
Okay.
SC
(Garble)

--- PAGE 224 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 8:24P GET 55:11 165/2
SC
Right under Jim, now, he's actually standing
on a - what looks to be a can here. And, for the sake of
all the people back there, housed inside this can is the -
the LM acsent engine, where hopefully, you can see my hand
resting on top of right now. The engine that we use to get
off of the Moon. (Garble). Immediately adjacent to the
engine cover here, I have my hand on a - a white box now,
which has been shown before. This happens to be Jim's PLSS,
or the back pack which'll supply oxygen and water for cooling
while on the lunar surface. This device we hope to make
use of for - a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much
as 5 hours. Right - right behind the PLSS, a couple of little
square packages I now have my hand on here; one here and one
right below; are our OPS's, which are in essence the emergency
oxygen supplies, which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes.
These are when we get ready to mount up and head outside,
will be placed up on top of the PLSS.
SC
(Garble).
SC
The second back pack is mounted down on the -
the LM floor. Positioned right between the two of us. I have
my hand on it, at this time.
CAP COM Roger, Fred, we see it. The picture's
coming through real good, and your description is good. We
see Jim's got the camera oriented the way we like to look
at it. So, keep talking.
SC
Okay. I guess everybody has pretty much
envisioned the space program as being all a lot of exotic
electronics, and certainly a lot of it is. But, I thought
I'd bring out a couple of items here, in conjunction with
the PLSS. After the first EVA, you get a very accurate
measurement of the amount of water that's left in the PLSS'es,
we're going to make use of this bag I'm showing now, to
collect the remaining water out of the PLSS and see just
how much we really did have left. And, hopefully, on future
missions to be able to extend safely the allowable time on
these units, even a little further. And, my other hand, I
have the mechanism by which we determine just how much water
we really have in this bag.
SC
And I guess this an apt description for
this device would be a fish scale. And you can see I'm
weighing myself right now, and it says I weigh actually
less than zero right now. Guess it's calibration isn't too
good.
CAP COM
That'll be the day.
SC
I think even you'd weight zero here, Jack.
CAP COM
Touche.
P AO
Apollo Control, Houston. We now show 13 at
175 000 nautical miles in altitude.
SC
Houston, this is Jim. Since Fred's been in
the lunar module, since he's the Lunar Module Pilot, this

--- PAGE 225 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 8:24P GET 55:11 165/3
SC
- is the first time that he's felt that he's
right side up.
CAP COM
Roger, Jim.
SC
I might tell you that we're looking at right
now, that round bag that's just behind Fred holds our vacuum
hose; and when we get back inside the LM we hook the vacuum
off our suits, and it's resting or it's attached to the
hatch which will - we will open to go onto to the lunar
surface, and of course, to come back in. The hatch which we
hook up to now is a round hatch which is our docking hatch
between the - between Odyssey and Aquarius.
CAP COM Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum
cleaner there, now.
SC
Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is the -
levva which has also been shown before, it's a head
garment for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm bringing
Jim's out here to show a couple of mods. One problem before
is that the cast of characters down on the surface haven't
been able to be distinguished apart very well. So, not
only Jim's suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can
see his levva also has a - a redish -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 226 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 8:37P GET 55:24:00 166/1
SC
- so not only Jim's suit has the red
stripes on it but, as you can see, his levva also has a red
stripe.
SC
And now you can see one other mod here
too, Jack, which I hadn't really seen myself before. I guess
on 12 Pete and A1 commented about having trouble with sunlight
in the eyes so on our levvas they put on a new center section
which you can pull down and use sort of like a baseball cap.
SC
Okay, Jack, who fixed up our levva?
SC
How's the detail on this one, Jack?
CAP COM
Say again, Fred.
SC
Can you see any detail in this picture
now or am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?
CAP COM That affirmative. We get a good picture
of the levva there and it's coming through loud and clear.
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away
my helmit, you are looking over into Fred's station now.
How's this picture, is it okay or do I have to adjust it?
CAP COM We have a hunch that the setting might be
in peak but we recommend average on the AOC if you haven't
got it there already.
SC
We're in average, Jack.
CAP COM
Okay. And we're getting a good picture
of the LMP side with the DEDA over there.
SC
Hey, Jack, one question on the command
module here. I have the dap right now on wide deadband, do
you want me to begin setting up narrow deadband and nulling
the rates and start PTC again?
CAP COM
Stand by, Jack.
SC
What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is a
new piece of hardware that we are taking along this time as
a result of some comments made on Apollo 12 flight.
SC
What Fred is opening up is a drink bag that we
place inside of our neck ring that will allow us to drink while
we are on the lunar surface. Pete and A1 did not have that
on Apollo 12 and they consequently got very thirsty. We hope
to allevaite this situation by having our own little bag of
water which with very little effort we can have a sip or two
while we are looking around and doing our geology work.
So if you hear any funny noises, it is probably just the
drink bag. Fred, you look happy. Fred is now looking through
our optical device. It is an instrument in which to align
our platform and Fred is now looking into just to see what
kind of an outside picture he might be able to get and then
he'll use the TV camera to look through our optical instrument
to the outside of the command module. A few minutes ago while

--- PAGE 227 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 8:37P GET 55:24:00 166/2
SC
we first came in we did manage to look
to the outside of the side hatch of the command module
through our optical instrument. Stand by, we'll try to see
what we can do here.
CAP COM Roger, Jim, break, Jack, we'd like you
to stay in the deadband you are now in and we'll make a
change when the TV is over. Another thing we would like for
you to do is check your PITCH and YAW on your high gain meter
so we can compare it with what we are seeing down here.
SC
Okay, it's showing about 28 degrees and
267.
CAP COM
20 and 267.
SC
28 and 267.
SC
Okay, Jack, have you got that picture
now.
CAP COM Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is
lighted and it's impossible to determine what you are looking
at right now. Maybe you could give us a little verbal des-
cription.
SC
Okay. It's looking through the AOT
in position 4, right rear, and we're looking back toward,
over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module.
Okay. Is it too dark a picture, Jack? You think the
F-stop open may help.
CAPCOM No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a
little bit. That's primarily what you have to do.
SC
Jack, we can't center it up anymore
because the side hatch is only one part of the AOT. The
rest of that blackness you see is really space.
SC
Okay. We'll try another one and a little
better centered. In fact, the only other one we have shows
the whole picture. We're in the forward D-10 of the AOT
now, position 2 and you should be seeing something from
here, like the radar antenna.
CAP COM Okay, we see you moving the camera up
to the AOT lens and we got a real good picture now.
SC
Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right
window now and not too far off in the distance now you can
see the objective and I'll zoom in on it a little here and
see if this brings it in better.
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 228 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-13-70 CST 8:47P GET 55:34:00 167/1
SC
That's actually beginning to look a little
bigger now. I can see quite distinctly some of the features
with the naked eye. And so far I guess I have to even agree
with Jim that it's still looking pretty gray and white spots.
CAP COM Okay Fred. We're getting a good
picture of your destination there.
SC
Jack, you've been looking at Fred's workshop
now and you can see the abort guidance and computer. And over
there tucked away in his armrest is our aclamation checklist
which be using very shortly. Up on the top of the window
we have our camera already mounted ready for photographing the
descent. And now Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I
found out on this flight SO far.
CAP COM He's not in the food locker, is he?
SC
That's his second favorite pasttime.
He's rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now
to find out to see what it's going to be like.
CAP COM Roger. Sleeping and then eating.
SC
It's kind of difficult here Jack,
getting into our hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I can
keep floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me.
SC
If you notice a few things floating
around, we found just about 1 or 2 washers occasionally.
SC
And for the benefit of those that
may wonder where Jim sleeps, it'd be a little difficult to
reach his hammock in here right now with the hatch open,
but his runs laterally in this direction (garble). So he
is the upper berth and I get the lower berth.
SC
And now while Fred's taking his
hammock down and restowed it, I might give you some idea
of what sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no
up or down and I'm situated on top of the ascent engine just
at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll reverse the camera
180 degrees and go from Fred, look through the tunnel and
get back at Odyssey and we might pick up part of Jack.
CAP COM There he is. We see him.
PAO
That's Jim Lovell now pointing the
camera at Jack Swigert in Odyssey. We're at 55 hours 38
minutes into the flight of Apollo 13.
SC
Okay, Houston. For the benefit of
the television viewers, we've just about completed our
little inspection of Aquarius and now we're proceeding through
the hatch gap into the tunnel and going back up the Odyssey.
CAP COM Ok ay Jim. It's been a great show
so far.

- 55 hours 39 minutes now into the
flight. We presently show Odyssey and Aquarius at an
altitude of 175,552 nautical miles now traveling at a speed
of 3171 feet per second. Although we copied no voice
confirmation as to exactly when spacecraft commander Jim
Lovell first went inside Aquarius. The flight plan called
for a ingress time of 54 hours 30 minutes and we assumed
that this occurred around that time.
SC
And finally, Jack's let me back
into the Odyssey as he - sled on through the tunnel here.
SC
Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?
CAP COM Yeah. We sure are. We've got a
good picture of the skipper there.
SC
Okay. What we can show you now -
a little - and a bit of - we've got the drogues on Fred's
couch in the command module right now. We stowed it
temporarily while we're checking out the Aquarius and
underneath is a couch, we've got the probes stowed. (Garble)
and we'll do a shot of it for you.
SC
You're looking now at our probes
the place on the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing
but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing and it's
much easier to move around. As a matter of fact, both Fred
and Jack commented as many people in the past have -
How much bigger the spacecraft appears in actual flight
when you have such ease moving compared to our simulator
switch (garble) difficult.
CAP COM Okay. We're seeing a good picture
of the probe there, Jim and looks like the characters there
shaved before the show this time.
SC
Well Fred said he had to keep up
his TV image.
SC
Yeah. That may be my first and
last time though, Jack.
SC
It took Fred one hour to shave.

We might give you a quick shot of our
entertainment on board the spacecraft, which has been keeping
us company for some time. (music) This little tape recorder
has been a big benefit has been a big benefit to us in passing
some of our time away on our transit to the moon, and it's
rather odd to see it floating like this in Odyssey, while
it's playing the theme from "2001". And of course the tapes
wouldn't be complete with "Aquarius".
CAP COM Okay, Jim. We're seeing the tape
recorder now and by the way, how long do you expect to keep
the TV on this evening?
SC
Well, when, stand by one. Yes, I've
got to put the cabin reprint valve in there Jack. Every
time he does that our hearts jump in our mouths. And Jack
anytime you want to terminate TV we're all set to go.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV
show. We think we ought to conclude it from here now, but
what do you think?
SC
Roger. Sounds good. This is the crew
of Apollo 13 wishing everyone there a nice evening and we're
just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and
get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.

like you to do is to..
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM We'd like you to roll right to 060 and
null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To
do that we would like you to enable quads C and D for the
maneuver use all your quads. And in precisely one minute,
we'd like you to terminate the battery charge and battery B.
One other request, we'd like to have
...
SC
Okay, we'll do it.
CAP COM One other request, we'd like you to verify
your high-gain configuration. We'd like to know what track
mode, what servo, and what beam width.
SC
Okay, Jack, during the TV we were auto-
track, narrow beam width and the primary electronics. And
we had a good lock up just after we started the maneuver, I
was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength
and it just seemed that right there about 239 degrees in yaw
that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would
go to zero and pitch would go to 90.
CAP COM Roger, we copy and the TV show was great.
SC
Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to
maneuver to 060 090 and 0.
CAP COM And 13, we'd like you to check C4 thrusters.
SC
Okay, Jack, the battery charge has been
terminated on the battery B.
CAP COM Roger, we see it Jack. And we got a
reading of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd like
to know if that's 2.0 precise or if it 2.1 or 1.9.
SC
No it's minus 2.0 precisely.

Thank you.
CAP COM 13, we've got one more item for you when
you get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks.
In addition have shaft and trunion

need it.
SC
Okay, stand by.

Okay, Houston. Hey, we've got a problem
here.
CAP COM This is Houston, say again please.

Houston, we've had a problem. We've had
a main B bus interval.
CAPCOM Roger. Main B interval. Okay, stand by
13 we're looking at it.
SC
Okay, right now, Houston, the voltage is
looking good. And we had a pretty large bang associated with
the caution and warning there. And if I recall, Main B was
the one that had a amp spike on it once before.

about that now. We wouldn't be using the LM platform for
until about 79 hours, so, let's go as is on the platform
for now. Over.
SC
Okay, we understand.
SC
Okay, Jack.
SC
And, Jack, we've turned off the waste dump
heater. If you're going to consider dumping any more waste
water, we probably ought to do it while the conductor's warn,
there.

Okay.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack, let's keep the water, no need for
a dump right now.
SC
All right.
CAP COM 13, Houston. We see the PROP-ISO valve on
RCS Quad Charlie, closed, so we'd like to also disable -
auto RCS feature in Quad Charlie.
SC
Do you want to isolate the auto RCS
features in Quad Charlie?
CAP COM
Affirmative.
SC
Okay, Jack, I didn't plan to reset that Quad
Charlie - PROP-ISO, do you want me to do that?
SC
Okay, we just tried it and Quad Alfa and
Charlie barberpols are showing.
CAP COM
Standby, Jim.
SC
Okay, Jack, that's a sec - secondary
propellant - are barber poles on Alfa and Charlie.
CAP COM 13, Houston. It won't do any good to try
to power the propellant valves, on A&C, so we want you to -
disable the auto on RCS Charlie. And we have a procedure
for getting power from the LM, we'd like you to copy down.
SC
Okay. Stand by, Jack. It sounds like good
news.
SC
Okay, Jack. About how long is it?
CAP COM
It's not a very 1ng procedure, Fred. We
figure we'll get about 15 minutes worth of power left in the
command module. So we want you to start getting over in the
LM and geting some power on that. And are you ready to copy
your procedure?
SC
Okay.

Activate 1 through step 3. Roger.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 57 hours
46 minutes ground elapsed time. The black team of flight
controllers is now stationed in mission control center
looking at possible alternate missions. As we have an
apparent serious oxygen leak in the cyrogenic oxygen in
the service module. And now in the process of powering
down the command module in less than 15 minutes remaining
of electrical power to the CSM. The command module search
tank has been charged with oxygen for entry.
CAP COM
13, say again please.
SC
We were curious about activation level
on the VHF.
CAP COM
Omit the VHF.
SC
- them too Jack. Okay.
PAO
In this scheme of going across to the
lunar module, still connected with the open tunnel, the lunar
module would serve as a sort of lifeboat for the crew of Apollo 13.
Sometime later in the mission it is expected that they would
return to the prereturn trajectory, which they left yesterday
in the midcourse burn number 2. At the pericynthion near the
moon they would use the descent propulsion system of the lunar
module for transearth injection burn at about 79 hours,
30 minutes Ground Elapse Time. This would produce a day early
entry at about 142 hours. That is a day earlier than a nominal
prereturn entry. We're continuing to monitor the situation
and still live on air ground.
CAP COM Jack, this is Houston. We want you to
keep the IMU up and keep the lights on so you can see in there,
and leave battery A off and at the appropriate time we'll put
it on main A, and we're going to keep the IMU up SO as we can
put a course align in the LM.
SC
All right. Real good. Right now we're
charging battery A. Do you want to discontinue that?
CAP COM Discontinue the charge on battery A,
Jack.
SC
Okay Jack. Discontinue charge on
battery A. You give me the call and I'll turn just my AC on.
CAP COM Roger, and we want you to keep the lights
up and the IMU on.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
And Jack, we'd like you to leave the
COM configuration as is until we get COM with the LM.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM And 13 this is Houston. I've got another

CAP COM procedure for the LM. A short one.
SC
Okay. Ready to copy Jack.
CAP COM Okay. On panel 11 we'd like you to
close the LGC DSKY circuit breaker. Then we want you to go to
activation 25. Do steps 1, 2, and 3. Then go to activation 30,
and that will give us a dock DIMU course align. Over.
SC
Roger. Panel 11 close LGC circuit
breaker. Activation 25, do steps 1, 2, 3, and then do complete
activation 30. Is that correct.
CAP COM That's affirmative. On panel 11 LGC
DSKY circuit breaker closed.
PAO
This is Apollo Control. We have confirmation
now that 2 of the Apollo 13 crewmen are indeed in the lunar
module.
CAP COM And in the LM, lets go to panel 11 and
close the SUIT fan circuit breaker and get SUIT fan cranked
up.
SC
Okay. Panel 11, close SUIT fan circuit
breaker, and we'll get the SUIT fan cranked up.
CAP COM That's affirm. And Jack in the CSM,
go to by-pass on the radiators and try GLY COL pump off.
SC
Okay. Pull the by-pass, GLYCOL pump
going off.

Okay.
P AO
This is Apollo Control at 57 hours 58
minutes ground elapsed time. To recap briefly the situation
here in Mission Control Center, we have an apparently serious
problem with a leak in the cryogenic oxygen in the Service
Module, which provides the electrical power system coming out
of the fuel cells, and also, breathing oxygen for the crew.
Now in the process of manning the Lunar Module. Standby.

12, Step 3, which is get the batteries in high taps. Over.
SC
Okay. How you going there? Activation
12, Step 3.

Under this alternate mission, the Lunar
Module would serve as a lifeboat to bring the Apollo 13 crew
back to Earth. That is its consumables, oxygen, electrical
power -
SC
Jack, have you reached Aquarias?
CAP COM
Aquarias, Houston. Say again please.
SC
Okay, I was just making a COMM check here
(garbled).
CAPCOM
Roger, we see him, Fred, and I'm reading
you loud and clear.
SC
Okay. Didn't think I'd be back this soon.
SC
Okay, what next, James? Cross the line?
SC
Doing right. Take your time.
PAO
The current thinking is to use the Lunar
Module descent propulsion system, a big engine of the LM to
propel the entire spacecraft stack to higher velosity as
they go around behind the Mo on to come back to Earth a day
earlier than a normal free return trajectory would return the
spacecraft.
CAPJOM We'd like you to on your alignment -
can you continue right on through the final line activation
31 - go right on through Step 7. Over.
SC
Okay. You want to go on 31 through Step
number 7. Check.

Okay, I want you to double check my arithmetic
to make sure we got a good course align. The roll cal
angle was minus 2 degrees. The Command Module angles were
355 57, 167 78, 351 87.
CAP COM Okay, Jim, we copy the roll cal at minus
2.0. The Command Module is 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.
SC
Okay. Verb 41 we've done that. Okay.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Request High Bit Rate,
please.
SC
You want High Bit Rate?
CAP COM
That's affirmative. Fred won't pass us
anything.

Three - GT, we need the GT. What is it?
What's that? 58, 5807. 58 what?
PAO
This is Apollo Control. Apollo 13 crewmen
Jim Lovell and Fred Haise are just completed -
SC
Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Aquarius.
SC
Here are the gimbal angles. Command module
356 69 163 42 346 67. Aquarius is 302 26 345 92 011 79.
Over.
CAP COM
Okay, Jim. I got Command Module 356 65
163 42 346 67. Aquarius 302 26 345 92 011 78.
SC
I have 011 79.
CAP COM
Say again, please.
SC
The LM middle gimbal is 011 79.
CAP COM
011 79, got it.
PAO
Those angles being read back from Aquarius
and from Odyssey were from the coarse alignment of the
Lunar Module guidance system platform. Returning to the
alternate mission now being considered, the descent propul-
sion system transearth injection burn would take place at
about 79 hours 30 minutes ground elapse time. Producing
an entry at about 142 hours. At this point in the trans-
lunar coast it is cheaper and swifter to coast on around
the Moon and come back to Earth than it is to do a deep
space abort. Continuing to monitor air-ground from
Apollo 13, this is Apollo Control.
SC
Houston. (garbled)
CAP COM
Odyssey, Houston. We need a command reset on
your on your COMM, and then we'd like you to power down to
CMC, power down the IMU, heaters OFF on IMU, but leave
the battery on.

SC
Houston, this is Odyssey. Go ahead.
CAPCOM
Okay, Jim.
SC
Copy it down.
CAP COM
Okay, Jim. I think I'm reading Jack, now.
But what we wanted to do is to get us a command reset.
And then power down to CMC, power down the IMU, turn the
IMU heater OFF, leave battery A ON. Over.

BAT A ON.
CAP COM
That's affirm, thank you.
SC
Okay. I just got a master alarm and main BUS A
undervolt and I'm starting to power down, now. The only advantage
to doing this early if we can power back the LM back down. The
only advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn now in
the midcoarse and then power the LM down. Otherwise, we
got to keep the LM powered up clear till we get around the
Moon. Plus it will be inside in the burn. I just hope the G&N
hangs up on (garbled) I sure would hate to do that one
manual. Oh, boy.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. 58 hours
46 minutes ground elapsed time. Lovell and Haise still
powering up the lunar module, getting attitude control,
aligning the platform. In preparation for what turns out
to be an alternate mission in which no lunar landing will
be possible. However, the spacecraft will fly around the
moon. At this point in translunar coast, it is more econo-
mical and propellant and time to continue to coast on around
the moon and come back to earth interssection trajectory.
In about 20 minutes in the Houston New Center there will be
a press conference in the small briefing room. Stand by.
CAP COM
Any stars out the LM window?
SC
We'll have to wipe them off, Jack.
They're coated with water right now.
SC
Can I get a towel?
CAP COM
Roger. As soon as you get a chance
to - while you're in position - to take a look, we'd like
to know if you can see stars for alignment purposes.
SC
Okay. Jim's going to be in trouble
in their present attitude out his side. The sun's up. Wait
one.
SC
What have you got? How much you got
left Battery A. OK. They said they (garloed) they were thinking
right now
SC
They're talking about powering down
and doing a P51 here.
SC
No. You're thinking about P52.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Negative on the
P51. We want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to
be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator
work we're going to crank up. And SO if you can give us
information as to what stars you can see out the window, we
can make that correlation.
SC
Would you say one more time?
Repeat the top two.
CAP COM Jim, what we want you to do is go
with your current final line and disregard the P51. What
we're attempting to do is to crank up some LMS simulations
to correlate what we can get out your window with what we
can get out the LMS window to see if that will help us any.
So when you can see some stars, if you can, you think you can
recognize them? And recognize constellations please let us
know.
SC
Okay. We'll check it. Stand by.

Hey, Jim. Why don't one of our waters
(garbled) - Okay. Let's control - What else can we fill up
there?
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. You're not going
to be able to uplink you with time because of the IU and
we have a frequency problem there. But what I'd like to do
is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give
you a mark and then you can put it into the disky from there.
Over.

Okay. Stand by.
SC
Wait a minute. Why do we need a
mission timer right now anyway? I me an that bad, they can
tell us.
SC
Well, I'd rather have a timer going
so that we can put it up on the disky. So we should have a mission
timer.
SC
Is that what he wants to do?
SC
Yes.
SC
Hey, OMNI.
SC
Great.

CAP COM
Okay. And one other thing we noticed,
when you pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pressure
in the ascent tanks and so we want to have you verify that
the ascent feeds are closed. In order to do that, on panel

getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and
trying to set up something for PTC and taking a look at
consumables as opposed to flight plan, etc., and as soon as
we get all that information we'll pass it up to you. We
also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking
at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alinement
procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out
the window, so if you ever are able to see any stars out
there and think you can do an alinement out the window, why,
let us know.
SC
Okay. Jack, right now we're not able,
to - the floodlight's reflecting off the thrusters and
whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still
with us, but the stars are hard to find and why in what
respect do you want us to do the stars out the window just
to test the LM's run - is that correct?
CAPCOM That's affirmative. We like to
correlate the information we get with your's so that if we
can use it to update the platform we can. What we're really
trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS aline so we
can power down the platform.
SC
This is Aquarius, we're getting an
awful lot of static on the uplink now and we're not reading
you at all. I have good signal strength and - -
CAP COM How do you read now, Aquarius?

or information regarding descent propulsion system abort for
minimum return time this maneuver, should it be done, would
come at 79 hours 25 minutes 26 seconds ground elapsed time
at an altitude above the moon of 205 nautical miles. The
maneuver would be 1797.7 feet per second posigrade, burn

- might try is to put the Service Module
between you and the Sun and then to see if you can see anything
out the window in that attitude.

work is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the constellations
all recognizable when we put the Service Module - in our case

How me, now?
SC
Okay, we're reading you loud and clear,
Jack. I hope it stays this time.
CAP COM Okay. We'd like to brief you on what
the plan is. We're, at this time, water critical in the LM.
We'd like to use as little as possible. To do this, we're
going to plan to make a free return maneuver of 16 feet per
second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're
going to power down the PNGS and then we'll, at 79 hours,
we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what
we got. But we'd like to get that PNGS powered down as soon
as possible. That would be after the midcourse and so
how do you feel about making a 16 foot per second burn in
37 minutes.
SC
Well, we'll give it a try, Jack, if
that's all we've got. That a 16 foot per second DPS burn
in 37 minutes?
CAP COM Roger. We're working up a pad for it,
but we wnat to know what you think about doing it at that time.
SC
Well, we'll do it. Could you give us
a little bit more time?
CAP COM Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested
time from you. We can figure out a free return maneuver for
any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time
you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a pad.
SC
Okay, that sounds good. I think if we
have a little bit more time we want to do it right stand
by one.
SC
Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 1:33A GET 60:20:00 194/2
SC
How's that?
CAPCOM Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and
30 minutes? That's an hour and five from now.
SC
Okay. We'll do it and we want to make
sure we talk back and forth now to make sure we get this burn
off right.
CAPCOM
Affirm.
SC
Okay, in the interim, Jack, I looked
around again and I s aw that we have a radar and a landing
radar heater breaker in - can I pull those out?
CAP COM Affirmative. Pull them both out.
CAP COM And now we want to ask you a question
about alignments, and so forth. We wanted to know if you
can see any stars out of the AOT. We also wanted to know if
you could use the service module to cast a shadow on the LM
windows and then look out the windows to see stars for P51
COAS alinement.
SC
Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're
pitching around I can not use the AOT to see stars. We're
just not able to see them at all. Now we may be able to
maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll and see stars. Right
now we haven't been able to. The AOT is useless. The command
module structure is just radiating too much light into the
telescope.
CAP COM Okay, and how about using the service
module to cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you
could do that, can you see stars for a COAS alinement?
SC
We could give that a try, Jack,
although I don't know how successful it will be. We tried to
do it - the light shines off our quads which makes it diffi-
cult to see stars. We do have the earth and moon, if that
can be of assistance.
SC
Another problem right now, Jack,
I'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out
that one but there are about a thousand or SO foam stars out
here from - left over from some of the debris it's hard to
discern what's the real and what's not real.
CAP COM Okay. That's good information and
during the time - we see you're continuing to pitch if you
ever get in a position where you think the AOT might be of
some use, we'd like you to periodically look out of it and
see if you can see some stars that would enable you to get
a P52.
SC
Okay, will do. And also let me ask
you a question. In this configuration, docked, you have to
use the GTCA to control pitch and roll, and just how much
can we use that without really changing our trajectory? We
only have 60 miles to play with.
CAP COM Roger, we'll put that to them

CAP COM Stnadby one, Fred. Okay, Fred, let's go
ahead. Step 1, page 1. Everybody's listening.
SC
Okay, I've looked around and I've essentially
done Steps 1 through 5 with the exception of floodlights and
utility lights and I think we'll just do without those.
CAP COM Roger. Your choice.
SC
Okay, on EPS activation, we're through
step we're through that bottom of that page. That's all
done.
CAP COM We concur. Page 2.
SC
Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step
4 and we're now sitting with all 4 amps our descent Batts
on high voltage taps, so I'll scratch off Step 4.
CAP COM Roger, and in Step 5 we want to leave
Inverter 1 circuit breaker OPEN.
SC
Roger. In Step 5, we'll leave Inverter 1
CB OPEN.
CAPCOM
Omit Step 6.

CAP COM
Aquarius, we recommend that you leave the
Caution Warning off on page 3.
SC
Okay. I was going to say that next. Page
3, we'll just scratch Item 1 and Item 2, I've already got the
RCS ON. I don't know if I gave you the time or you got the
time on the Primary Vat Flow number 1 OPEN.
CAPCOM
We got the time.
SC
Okay. Let's go to the CB pages now.
CAP COM
Fred-0, did you close the engine control
breaker in Panel 11?
SC
What control is that, Jack?
CAP COM Did you close the S and C engine control
breaker on Panel 11? As we got Step 1 there on Page 3.
SC
Okay. Yes, the EPS descent ECA control
breaker is CLOSED on 11.
CAP COM Roger, and how about the on Panel 11,
S and C engine control CLOSED? AFT OMNI, Fred.
SC
Okay. We're in OMNI and we have the S
and C engine control breaker CLOSED.
CAP COM Roger. Let's go on with the circuit breaker
panel checkout.

- be easier to give you what I got in.
Okay in the top row on 11, we have the 4 AC Bus Tie breakers
in and the AC Bus volts breaker in, and that's it. Second
row, we have the 4 TCA breakers in. We have the (garbled)
under flight displays and commander's FDAI. And likewise
under AC Bus A we have a (garbled) and a commander FDI breaker
in. That's it. On row 3, we have signal conditioner 1. We
have the ATTCA PGNS. We have the engine control breaker,
attitude direct control breaker, and the under lighting
A Non dock component breaker in. One other, ED logic power

Okay, in the bottom row, EPS, we have the backseat tie both
in, and we have the cross tie balance loads in, the lunar,
Bus time, descent ECA control, descent ECA and the DC Bus
volts breaker.
CAP COM
Roger. We copy.
SC
That does it for Panel 11.
CAP COM
Okay. Standby.
SC
Okay. As I see it some of the short ones -
we need to DECA gimball in sooner or later.
CAP COM That's affirm. Close the DECA Gimball.
SC
And probably - okay, DECA Gimball and
sooner or later, we're going to need DECA Power igues also.
CAPCOM All right, DECA Power will come up later
in a procedure, Fred-0.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. On your circuit breaker
check list on Panel 11 and 16 we want you to configure the

With the activation power up, we're
starting right now.
SC
Houston, we might as well leave our
RCS DCA's in, right?
CAP COM Affirmative, Jim. Leave your RCS
TCV's in on panel 11.
SC
Check that.
SC
Yes. I just used my Pinte; pen
and made those white ones black ones.
CAP COM
Roger. Same on 16, Fred.
SC
Rog.
SC
And you might look there, Houston,
to see what circuit breakers are required, like the tape recorder.
CAP COM
We're looking.
CAP COM
Okay, Jim, on panel 11 over there,
you can also leave open the rendezvous heater breaker and
the landing radar heater breaker, in addition to the tape
recorder.
SC
They're out.
SC
I'm leaving the fuel inject too. Like
the suit fan 1 is still in, RCS system is still in, the
GTA's. Attitude direct control is in.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
How about if I leave the VHF A and B
on?
SC
Switch to forward OMNI.
CAP COM
Okay. We can leave the VHF power
down too.
SC
And do you want the secondary S-band?
CAP COM
Negative on secondary S-band. Leave
them open.
SC
Up data link is in. Do you want that
in or out?
CAP COM
Leave the up data link open. We'll
call for it when we want you to put it in.

to leave the floodlights breaker open.
CAP COM
Concur.
SC
And we're again up to - do you want
the CWEA enabled.
CAPCOM
Negative on the CWEA.
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay. Since we're - are we going to
power up the AGS or should I concern myself with the ATCA
breaker?
CAP COM Negative on the AGS. However, Fred,
we need the ATCA breaker in.
SC
Okay. ATCA breakers in. Yes. I
guess for the backup power supply.
SC
How about ATCA AGS?
CAP COM
Negative on ATCA AGS.
SC
And I'm leaving the suit flow control
breaker open.
CAP COM
Let's close the suit flow control
breaker. It doesn't take any corrent.
SC
And, Jack, OMNI over now.
SC
Okay. Without suits it doesn't do
us much good either.
SC
Okay. And are we going to continue
to be able to operate on the OMNI's, Jack. So can I leave
the S-band antenna power down.
CAP COM Okay, Fred. We don't plan to use the
steerable antenna, although, we want to leave the heaters on.
So it looks you ought to open up comm S-band antenna but leave
S-band antenna heaters closed.
SC
Thank you. Comm S-band is open, S-band
heater breaker is still closed.

It's open.
CAP COM
Okay, Aquarius, We're GO on the circuit
breaker configuration as you have it now.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM
And Aquarius, tests on the simulator
just showed that if you want to let the PGNS damp hold your
attitude for you, it will.
SC
Okay, very well.
SC
And, Jack, because it will take quite
a while to get back to the attitude, I think we ought to
think about going there very shortly.
CAP COM Roger, I have a pad for you. I have a
P30 maneuver pad.
SC
Roger. Standby.
SC
Go right ahead, Jack.
CAP COM
Okay, we want you to hold your maneuver
until we finish making the load. We haven't completed it
yet. Are you ready to copy P30 maneuver pad?
SC
That's affirm.
CAP COM Okay. Here we go. The purpose is
modcourse correction for free return. NO UN 33, 061, 29,
4284 minus 00213, plus 0004, minus 00312, HA and HP are N/A,

CAP COM That's a good read back, Fred. I'd like
to verify, however, in NO UN 81, in B sub y, it's plus three
balls four one.
SC
Okay, NO UN 81, B sub y is plus 00041.
capcom Good readback. Let's press on with
the checklist.
SC
Okay, and Jack, find out about using
PTCA to maneuver with.
CAP COM Okay, we're finished with the computer.
It's yours and we recommend using the PTCA to maneuver with.
SC
Roger.
SC
Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6,
Jack, under PNGS turn on and self test, we've done everything
except the self test here on this page. Do you want to
do that at this time?
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius, negative on the PGNS
self test. Page 7.
SC
Okay. I'll scratch page 6 and on page 7,
we're not goint to activate the - or rather we have the
upband activated, ECS activation I have all done. And,
at the bottom of the page, the docked IMU course alinement
is done.
CAP COM
Roger.

CAP COM Okay, the only item on page 10 is to deploy
the landing gear.
SC
Okay, we'll do that now.
SC
Okay, the landing gear are down and locked,
Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've done all of that.
CAP COM We verify that. Page 12.
SC
Okay, and I assume that among all the
numbers you pumped up we've got a REFSMMAT and state vector,
is that correct?
CAP COM That's affirmative. You've got that. So
you can delete page 12.
SC
Hey, 13, you've read us up the final line
angles and we'll CAPCOM
Affirmative.
SC
Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to
do DAP SET and the gimball throttle test.
CAP COM That's okay, Aquarius, we recommend omitting
the DAP SET gimball throttle test - just make sure the DCA
power and DCA gimbal circuit breakers are closed.
SC
Okay, we're going to proceed with the DAP
SET gimball throttle test is that correct? Or did you say
delete it?
CAPCOM Aquarius, delete the DAP SET gimball throttle
test. Just assure that the DCA power and the DCA gimball are
closed.
SC
Okay. Houston, the DCA power is open at
this time. Do you want me to close it?
CAP COM Affirmative, Jim. Close the DCA power.
SC
It's closed. We deleted that.
SC
Okay, also out of that list, Jack, we
need the commander's throttle set to throttle (garbled).
SC
Houston, if I recall the launch set of
the gimballs the GDA's are not correct here. When are
we going to get those set for the burn?
CAP COM
Standby one.
CAP COM Okay, here's the word on the DAP SET
gimball throttle test. Let's do step one and step two, and
that' 11 get our gimball set.
SC
Roger.
SC
Okay, Jack, we're going to have to back
up on this if we're going to follow the procedure here,
which has us go mode control PGNS AUTO, we're going to have
to pull the TCA breakers to keep from burning jets.
CAP COM
Standby, Fred.
CAP COM Standby on step one, Fred. We're getting
the word for you. How do you like this sim?

It's a beauty.
CAPCOM
Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the
DAP SET gimball throttle test as per the checklist. Go PGNS
AUTO and proceed.
SC
Well, we're going to fire a burst as soon
as we go to AUTO because we've got those thrusters in - the
thruster circuit breakers. Do you want us to do that and stop?
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go
to AUTO and let the thrusters fire and settle down and proceed
with the test.
SC
We're in PGNS AUTO.
CAP COM
Roger, your DAP is set, you're in wide
deadband. That ought to do the trick.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM
Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius. We're
ready to proceed with the test.
SC
Okay, we're proceeding.

This is Apollo Control. We've got an
ignition countdown clock running here now in Control Center
showing 19 minutes 19 seconds to ignition on the mid-
course correction which will place Apollo 13 back on a free

And, Houston, it's doubtful right now
whether we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration.
The only way we could possibly get alinement is the earth
and the terminator or the moon and it's terminator and
should have you look at a powered down - keeping the PGNS if
at all possible.

Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this
attitude, the Sun is reflecting off of the - off quad 4
so bright that it would ruin any night vision we still got
particles floating around us, I'll must take a long
look and see if I can see any star patterns.
CAP COM Roger. Aquarius, we're going to have to
hand you over to a different site now, and we think maybe things
will work better if this time we turn off the S-band transmitter
receiver, and bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?
SC
Okay. Standby one. Okay. I understand
you want us to turn off the S-band transmitter receiver and
bring it up in 5 minutes. Is that correct?
CAP COM
That's affirmative.
SC
Tell us when. And you want us to maintain
attitude control.
CAP COM
Affirmative on the attitude control.
SC
That's AUTO attitude control. Okay,
you maintain AUTO attitude control. Okay, Jack I'm back on the
line now. On the S-band, you want me to turn off the trans-
mitter receiver and the power amps are off for 5 minutes. Is
that - will you give me the word is that what you want?
CAP COM Aquarius, leave the power amplifier the
way it is. Just turn the transmitter receiver off for 5 minutes.
Now.
SC
Okay. You tell me when.
CAP COM
Okay. Turn it off now. See you in 5
minutes.
SC
Okay. It's gone off. Gone off for 5
minutes.

This is Apollo Control at 61 hours 45
minutes ground elapsed time. The process of handing over
from the Goldstone station to the Honeysuckle station in
Australia. There will be a gap of about 5 minutes while this
handover is taking place. Meanwhile the people here in
Mission Control Center are looking at ways of setting up some
sort of scheme for passing thermal control or Bar-B-Que mode
of thermal balance for the spacecraft, during the remainder of
the coasting flight using the abort guidance system of the
Lunar Module to provide the attitude control to set up this
slow roll. Apollo 13 now 188 863 nautical miles out from
Earth. Velosity 3 084 feet per second. At 61 hours 46

CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, how do you read?
SC
Okay, you're loud and clear there, Jack.
CAP COM
Roger, same here. We're still dis-
cussing the next move.
SC
I figured it. Let's just make it a
good one.
CAP COM
We're looking real close at water usage
profiles and right now things are kind of swinging toward
leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the LGC, but
we'll have more word for you shortly. And we recommend for
sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. We recommend you
don't make any urine dumps if you can help it because it'll
make the debris problem worse than it is now. And we have
some items that you might want to transfer to the LM, some
towels, some penlights, some fecal bags, UTS. and do you
have any more items that we can help you out with at the
moment?
SC
Okay, stand by on your latter list,
Jack. I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work
through the UCD and all the bags we've got and real quick
here can you give a DAP load we want in here now to conserve
the RCS.
CAP COM Okay, for attitude control coordinates,
we're recommending the manual control VERB 76 and watch
your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you have now
looks good.
SC
Okay, it's at hold VE RB 76 for the guy
on watch. And the DAP mode we've got right now is okay.

is to leave the IMU powered up, power down the LGC and power
down other nonessential items. WE'll be coming up with a
more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. Over.
SC
Okay. The decision is to keep the
platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by

Wait a minute, Jack. Did you say
pericynthion or perigee?
CAP COM
I meant pericynthion.
SC
Ah. That's better.

CAP COM Roger. We're getting you a flight
plan update. We're still computing on your next burn and
we're getting ready to give you procedure for power down.

This is Apollo Control, 62 hours 24 min-
utes ground elapsed time. Under discussion here in the
control room are the various means by which the spacecraft
thermal balance can be maintained through the night with a
minimum amount of propellant and electrical usage. One man
will be on watch in the crew throughout the night and
they' looking at the possibility of manual control attitude
to arrive at some sort of passive thermal control mode.
Apollo 13 now 190 026 nautical miles out, velocity 3064 feet
per second. At 62 hours 25 minutes ground elapsed time,
this is Apollo Control.
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius, here's what we're going
to do. We'd like you to point the LM X-axis either north
or south, that's the positive X-axis. It appears to us
that it would be closer to orient the LM plus X-axis toward
the south. Do that with the LGC powered up and using the
TTCA. After that, we propose to power down the LGC to
save some power. However, this means that we lose the use
of the TTCA and we'll have to control the spacecraft with
the hand controller in the direct mode. Request your
position on these two items.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, how do you read?

SC
Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to
place the LM plus X axis to the south due to the PTCA
with the LGC powered up. Then by powering down the LGC
we'll lose a PTCA. I wasn't to successful in controlling
the spacecraft in attitude only, but I might be able to
keep it out of gimbal lock.
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. And keep your
ball powered up and go to DIRECT on the hand controller.
And maintain attitude in a direct position.
SC
Okay, understand. Do you want some
sort of a PTC mode, Jack?
CAP COM Affirmative. We'll take whatever PTC mode
you can set up, Jim.
SC
Okay. Since you know our approximate
attitude how about just getting me something to find you
on the DSKY for a southernly plus X direction.
CAPCOM Roger. Stand by one.
SC
And one other question, Houston. Did you
say power down the DSKY or the LGCTB going into 06 or
multiple circuit breaker?
CAPCOM Stand by on powering down the DSKY, Jim.
We'll give you the procedure for that. The procedure that
we -
SC
Okay.
CAP COM The procedure that we have is listed in
several places. It's in the contingency checklist under
power down, on page 1, second paragraph. And we'll give
you the word when we want you to do that. That is LGC only
not to power down the IMU, but we'd like to have you hold
off on that till we send you the word.
SC
Understand.
CAPCOM Aquarius, while we're working on this we
have a proposed flight plan update for your working and
resting cycles. And you ready to copy?
SC
Okay. Do you want me to write this in the
flight plan for stay, Jack?
CAP COM You probably write this on a piece of scratch
paper. This is pretty easy.
SC
Okay. Go ahead we've got a lot of scratch
paper.
CAP COM Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest
while the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the
sack about 63 hours coming up in 25 minutes, and you get
to rest for 6 hours. You get up at 69 hours. At 70 hours
the Commander and the Command Module Pilot sleep for 6 hours
until 76 hours. Around 76 and a half to 77 hours we'll do
a P51 and a 52. At 78 30 we'll load P30 and align AGS to
PGNS. Mission time for second burn will be presently 79
25 26.5 and we'll have a pad shortly. We suggest that all

82 hours, and the CMP, CDR eat while you are sleeping. And
that you grab a bite as soon as you can. Over.
SC
Okay, Jack. As I read that the LMP is to
go to sleep at 63 00 for about 6 hours. During that period
the CDR and CMP are to try to get a bite to eat. I'm to
awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP sleep at 70 hours and they
are to awake at 76 hours. And we should plan on doing our
P51, P52 at 76 hours or 76 30. At 78 30 we are to load a -

P52 at 76 hours and 76 30. At 78 30 we can
load a P30 and align AGS to PGNS. Second maneuver is to
take place at 79 25 26.5 mission time. Then we are all to
eat at 81 to 82 hours.
CAP COM Okay. With a minor modifications your P51
P52 will be about 77 hours and that's a period of darkness.
Commander and the CMP ought to eat around 68 to 69 hours and
you should eat between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up.
We have left an hour in there where everybody is awake to
together to talk things over. Go ahead.
SC
Okay. I'll eat after I wake up between 69
and 70.
CAP COM
Alright we have a -
SC
- correction -
CAP COM
Go ahead, Fred.
SC
Yes, we got the word the P51, P52 is going
to be done around 77 hours while we're in darkness.
CAP COM That's affirmative. And we have a work-rest
cycle laid out for further on which we can relay to you later.
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay, Houston. You have advice on what AGS
you want me to go to.
CAP COM
Okay. That'll be the next bit of information.
I'll get that for you, Jim.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
And Aquarius, just to get you thinking in
that direction, we've run a very thorough analysis and we've
found out that it's going to be cheaper to keep the LGC and
the disky up and turn the inverter and the ball off. It's
going to save us 1 amp, and also some water. So it looks
like what we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the
middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure on that,
and it'll also be easier control mode. We'll be able to
use the PTC through the dap.
SC
That sounds great, Jack.

for you. Ready to copy.

Okay. This is pretty easy. We see
you've already got VERB 16 NO UN 20 called up here and so we
want you to, in maneuver and PNGS attitude, hold, and use
the PPCA. We want you to, on the commander's ball, pitch
to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And when you do this, in
VERB 16 NOUN 20, on the DSKY, you ought to read plus 00120,
plus 26750, and plus 00450. Go ahead.

Okay. With the commander's ball to
pitch of 267.5 yaw minus 4.5. And we should have a 16 20

SC
Okay, Delta V Z Noun 81, is minus 02226.
CAP COM
Okay, good readback.
SC
Somehow htat didn't add up with the Delta
V X to give a Delta V R of that magnitude. It seems like it'd
have been bigger.
CAP COM Okay, we'll take another look at it, Fred.
SC
Okay, Houston, I'm not having too much luck
holding this particular attitude.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. Standby one.
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius, when you get her pretty much
in attitude, there, and it looks like you're as close as we
need to be, we'd like to try a control mode and see if it will
work. Sort of a semi PTC. We'll leave the ball powered up for
this and if this doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to
attitude hold mode. But standby one, please.
CAP COM We'd like you to think about this control
mode, Jim, and see if you think it might work from what you
know right now. We're a little skeptical but we'd like to
put it to you. So once you get in a pretty good attitude,
monitor in Verb 16, Noun 20, GO to PGNS man/man pulse, Verb 76,
as we have, and set up a Yaw rate a Yaw rate to the right,
monitor the middle gimball on R3 on the DSKY and see if she'll
kind of stabilize out. If not, the only other suggestion
we've got is to go to PGNS attitude hold. We'll keep the ball
up until you make this evaluation.
SC
- you cut out -
CAP COM
Okay, where'd you lose me, Jim?
S C
I lost you when you said try the control
mode, you're a little skeptical.
CAP COM Okay, from what you say, we had to be a
little skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to have you
try it and have you evaluate it. You can monitor the middle
gimball on R3. Before we power doen the ball we want your
evaluation. The next best choice is PGNS attitude hold. Over.

sentence there.
CAP COM Okay. I said that the DELTA VR that
Fred questioned computes well with the component, It's RMS.
SC
Okay, copy.
SC
Okay now, Jack let's go over this once
more. You wanted me to try out the control of the spacecraft
in the pulse mode. Is that correct?
CAP COM That affirmative. Set up a yaw right
rate and monitor the middle gimbal angle.
SC
I'm going to do that. I'm not too sure
whether I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can control
yaw in pulse, yaw in pulse on the ball.
CAP COM Roger, and remember we're not going
to have a ball there so that we're going to be monitoring
CDU's on the DSKY and if we get it off it will be pretty
hard to figure out where to fly back to, and, in addition,
have to control the omni's while we're doing this.
SC
Hello, roger.
CAP COM Without the ball I still have use of
the GTCA the control of the ar angle.
CAP COM Affirmative. You'll have the TTCA
for pitch and roll.

And Houston, did you see anything
wrong with this mixed up motion?

Jim, we'll look at it as soon as it comes up.
CAP COM Okay Aquarius. We're going to dispense
with this control mode. We'd like you to fly the machine back
to the original attitude that you had, and we'll go PGNS
attitude hold and then we've got to get that ball off the
line to save some power. And then in order to keep even heating
every 15 or 30 minutes we'll give you a call to give us 90 or

CAP COM Okay. Row 3 under COMM. Open displays,
close SE AUDIO, open VHF A transmitter and B receiver, close
the primary S-BAND circuit breakers, both of them. Open the
S-BAND antenna, PMP closed, TV open, and all the rest of
them opened under ECS except C02 sensor closed.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM Okay. Under row 4. Under heaters, your
SCS QUAD heaters should 4 of them be closed, open displays,
open S-BAND antenna, open sequence camera. Under EPS open
displays, close DC bus volt, open inverter 2, open ACCENT
ECA control and SNECA, close descent ECA, descent ECA control,
translunar bus tie, close cross tie bal loads, open cross
tie bus, close pad feed ties. Over.
SC
That's complete, Jack.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. And we've already got a change
to what I just told you. Under ECS close the cabin repress,
and ensure that the ASA breaker is closed under S and C.
SC
The ASA breaker is closed, but I closed the
cabin repress.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do
is, in order to maintain even heating, we just have to YAW
the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour in increments.
So we'll give you a call when it's time to YAW 90 degrees.
SC
Okay. We have to yaw the machine as I understand
it, Houston. And, you'll give it to me in increments of
90 degrees.

CAPCOM Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has
the following features. We got the flight control buses
cross tied through the bal load circuit breakers. And we have
AUTO cabin repress. One thing we'd like to do now is give
you an uplink, so immediately we have to on panel 11 close
the updata link circuit breaker. Go to POO and DATA. Over.

SC
Houston, Aquarius. Did you say that you
had a new PAD for us to copy?
CAP COM Jim, I passed that newest PAD that we
have to Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest. It's
PC plus 2 and begins with Noun 33 of 79 hours 27 minutes and
40. 13 seconds. Do you have that one?
SC
Okay. We got that one. What kind of a
attitude hold mode do you want us to do. Do you want us to do
wide dead band (garbled)
CAP COM Jim, the deadband is good the way it is.
It's 5 degrees if you want to stay in it, and stay in the PGNS
Att hold mode.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Two things, Jim. We want you to know that
there's some pretty big attitude errors in so if you go to
AUTO, the computer is going to try to crank you around and
the other thing is don't drink water out of the LM.
SC
Okay. You might think about this. You
know we lost the oxygen pressure in the Command Module.
CAP COM Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink.
The computer is yours, and you can open the updata link circuit
breaker.
SC
Okay. We've opened up the updata link
and we've gone off of data, and I've got 15 20 in the computer.
CAP COM Roger, Jim. I guess we're going to just
kind of perk away here now.
SC
Okay, Jack. One more question about
Odyssey here.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Jack.
SC
Okay, how about the Service Module 02 supply
valve? Do you want that OFF?
CAP COM
Affirmative. Service Module 02 supply OFF.
SC
Okay. On the way.
CAP COM And Jim, we receive program arm in there.
We think it's just got to do with pulling the updata link
circuit breaker. Uplink too fast.
SC
Roger. I don't see it. Should I reset?
CAP COM
Go ahead and reset, Jim.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Aquarius.
SC
One thought that might occur here is that
if we have low descent in water pressure, we might consider taking
the PLSS water and fill it in reverse. If that works, you might
look at a procedure for that.
CAPCOM That's a good thought. Let us bounce that
around a little.
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 311 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-14-70 CST 5:13A GET 64:00:00 216/1
CAP COM Okay, Jim. That's a good thought and
we've looked at that and it looks like that's feasible. So
if and when we need to do that we will.
SC
I have something else, Jack. Were
there plans made to make my 90 degree yaw, what I planned
on doing was going to NO UN 76 hold and just (garbled) several
times and compute the yaw start and hoping that pitch and
roll stay with the limit.
CAP COM Roger. It sounds like a good plan
and you can use your TTCA in min impulse pulse to take care of
pitch and roll.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. We see ascent
02 tank number 2 building up again SO we'd like to use some-
thing out of it SO turn on ascent 02 tank number two and
turn off descent 02.
SC
Roger. Open up ascent 02 tank number
2 and turn off descent.
CAP COM And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting
to think about C02 buildup up in the command module there SO
we've got a recommendation and what we're recommending is
that you take the commander's hoses in the LM and put a
cap over the red return hose and then figure out a way to
fasten thoe hoses so they blow up in the CSM by extending
them up as far as possible. And we'll get some flow off
the blue side circulate up and around the command module and
to keep the C02 level down.
SC
Roger. We agree with that too and
one problem is that the comm is connected securely to the
hose so we've got to get the comm cable off somehow to get
that we still have comm down here in the LM and have the
hose up there.
SC
Houston, we're trying to extend that
commander's hose by use of the vacuum hose.
CAP COM Sounds like a good plan if you can
work that out, Jim.
CAP COM Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose
there, I've got a some procedures for him to write down.
SC
Okay. Stand by.
SC
Okay, Jack. Is this a long one?
CAP COM Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's
a matter of verifying some valves and so forth.
SC
Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. We want you to go in, when you
can and verify the following valves and leave them as we
outline here. Repress package valve, off; emergency cabin
pressure, off; direct 02, off; demand rig, off; both water
accumulators, off; main rig A and B, open; water glycol -

--- PAGE 312 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 5:13 A GET 64:00:00 216/2
CAP COM correction - - water and then glycol
tank inlet and outlet, both. Now if you want to get some
water, we recommend that you momentarily turn the surge
tank on to pressurize the system and then turn it off and
take out water as required. Over.
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 313 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 5:23A GET 64:10 217/1
SC
And take out water is required. That's it
Jack, and another note on taking water. If you don't drain
enough water so - (garbled) Aquarius
SC
That wasn't it, Jack.
SC
Okay. One more note on the water, Jack.
If you don't bleed the pressure off when - don't take enough
water to leave the pressure off completely. The pressure's
at less down here is going to drain away in a period of 1 to
3 hours. So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might as
well save it. So if you want to eliminate that problem you
could completely drain the pressure off by putting the water
in a water bag and saving it that way.
SC
Yes. That's a good idea.
CAP COM
So that's the end of my -
SC
What I'll do - Let me repeat Okay let me
repeat it all back to you. Repress package valve off,
emergency cabin pressure off, DIRECT 02 off, both the demand
RGS off, both H20 glycol accumulators, water glycol accumulators
off, main A and B open, water in glycol tank inlet and outlet open,
for water momentarily pressure excert tank, take out water
as required, you're recommending drain out all the water until I
can't get any more water out of it in order to conserve the
oxygen.
CAPCOM Okay. We just want you to turn off the
water accumulators and not the glycol accumulator. Over.
SC
Okay. These are the water accumulators on
382, right?
CAP COM
It's affirm. The accumulators 382.

This is Apollo Control at 64 hours 28 minutes
ground elapse time. Briefly the situation with Apollo 13.
The crew in the last hour was passed up a pericynthion plus
2 hours maneuver which actually is primarily a speed up
maneuver to get them back to Earth somewhat earlier than the
normal free return would bring them. This maneuver would
come at 79 hours 27 minutes ground elapse time. Would
envolve 845 feet per second velocity change. Splash down
would be in the southwest Pacific, north of New Zealand at
about 142 hours 47 minutes ground elapse time. At the present
time the LM oxygen quantity is 50.6 pounds and 300 pounds of
water on board. Cabin pressure holding steadily and 4.7 up
to 5 pounds in both spacecraft. The tunnel between the two
is open so they share a common atmosphere. Apollo 13 now
193 700 nautical miles out from Earth, velocity 3005 feet
per second. Missions here in the control room have to do
with the power down procedures. How to conserve electrical
power, the water used in the coolant, for cooling the
various electronic systems in the spacecraft. How to
husband all these consumables to get the most milage from
them. And it's 64 hours 30 minutes ground elapse time and

We think we know where the platform is, Jim.
The tracking looks real good from the last burn, we feel
just a P52 will be required.

Okay Jim, we've come up with a COMM
recommendation which we hope will save some power by powering
down the power amplifier, if it works, and I'd like to read
up the steps to you and have you think about them for

back to me and then I'll have a remark.
SC
Okay. Biomed off. Low bit rate.
down voice backup power amp to prime. Circuit breakers, panel
16, power amp circuit breaker open. Range function switch
off.
CAP COM Okay, and the note says that you should
be able to hear us if we can't here you in a couple of minutes,
you should close the power amp circuit breaker on panel 16,
and we expect to save an amp or more on this. It should work
in the present attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude
we're thinking about powering up the sterible, leaving the
power amp off and, if we can good COMM mode we'll still
save some power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead.
SC
Okay. In this mode you should hear
us or we should hear you but if you can't hear us then we
ought to close power amp circuit breaker again. Is that
right.

This is Apollo Control 65 hours 45 minutes
ground elapsed time. Communications are rathery scratchy at
this time. Back over the past 8 or 10 hours of the mission
the problem first cropped up at about 55 hours and 58 minutes
ground elapsed time last evening when the crew first reported
an under voltage alarm on the command module main bus B. This
was their first hint that something was amiss, the pressure
rapidly dropped in the service module liquid oxygen tank
number 2 and fuel cells 1 and 3 failed shortly thereafter.
A decision was made to scrub any attempt at landing and con-
tinue on a lunar fly-by deep space abort type mission. The
increased load on fuel cell 2 and the dropping pressure in
the remaining liquid oxygen tank led to the decision to use
the lunar module for a sort of lifeboat to come back to
earth using its consumables for life support. The remainder
of the evening was spent in trying to get the power and water
profile pared down to get the most mileage out of these items.

And at 61 hours 30 minutes groud elapsed time
a 38 feet per second mid-course correction burn using the
descent propulsion system of the lunar module put the space-
craft back onto a free return trajectory which, if nothing
more were done, would cause the command module to enter in
the - to reenter the earth's atmosphere in the Indian Ocean
south of Mauritius at about 152 hours groud elapsed time.
However, another DPS or descent propulsion system burn is
being planned at approximately 79 hours 27 minutes ground
elapsed time with a velocity change posigrade of 845.5 feet
per second, which would bring the spacecraft home somewhat
more rapidly, about 10 hours sooner, as a matter of fact,
to splash down in the southwest Pacific at 142 hours north
of New Zealand and that's where the situation stands at the

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/14/70 CST 8:14A GET 66:59:24 225/1
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 67 hours, 23
minutes. Flight Director Glynn Lunney is still in the Mission
Control Center; there has been considerable discussions and
meetings on the floor here since his shift changed, he and
Flight Director Jerry Griffin. Director of Flight Operations,
Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, the Apollo Mission Director
Chet Lee, the Apollo Program Director Rocco Petrone and other
management officials have been holding some discussions.
We have no estimate on when Mr. Lunney will be able to get
away at this time. We will attempt to summarize for you some
of the discussions that have been going on here. We are still
leaning toward the burn at pericinthion plus 2 hours, that is
the descent propulsion burn at 79 hours, 27 minutes, 850 feet
per second; as an option, a number of people are taking a look
at the what is being termed as super fast return, would require
a larger burn at pericinthion plus and hour and a half; this
would bring us to a splash time of 118 hours VS. 142 hours,
however, to accomplish this, we would have to jettison the
service module. Preliminary data indicates that we may have
a thermal problem on the way back without the service module.
There are also some other aspects that need to be looked into.
This option is being held open and is being worked and will
be for the next several hours, however, as I say, all the
officials here are still leaning toward the pericinthion plus
2 hours, with a 142 hour return. In connection with the super
fast return, Astronaut Gene Cernan has been doing some work in
the trainer on star visibility problems, manual reaction control,
manual throttle work, and this option will be kept open for
some time. Another problem with the super fast return is that
we can't stand as much misalinement with the inertial platform
on a long burn as we can with the 142 hour return. At the
present time, we would feel more comfortable with the 142
hours return. We expect to be able to get a program 52 or
a platform aline, the program for alining the intertial plat-
form with the alinement optical telescope in the Lunar Module,
after the spacecraft arrives in the shadow of the Moon. There
is a 30 minutes period where we can look at the spacecraft
through telemetry and watch the how the alinement goes prior
to the time that we lose signal. We are 9 hours, 41 minutes
away from LOS, but there is a half hour period when the space-
craft will be in the shadow of the Moon, and an alinement
can be attempted. If we are unable to aline, we think that
we can do the burn with the present alinement. The result
so far of tracking since the last descent propulsion burn in-
dicates that the present alinement is good. We are looking
at a plan now that after the burn, we would power down to
17 amps; that's a minimum power down. With that power down,
we have enough water to last to 155 hours, ground elapsed
time. In addition to that, we would have the water from the
portable life support systems. The water use rate at this

--- PAGE 328 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/14/70 CST 8:14A GET 66:59:24 225/2
PAO
17 amp power usage would be 2.68 pounds
per hour. These projections also include two power-ups for
mid course corrections on their way home. And a procedure has
been worked out to use the Command Module's lithium hydroxide
cartridge for CO removal and we are presently yawing manually
2
90 degrees every 8 hours for passive thermal control; after the
burn, we may put a rate into the spacecraft, or roll rate into
the spacecraft, and let it go and attempt to set up some type
of passive thermal control that does not require complete
manual operation. The Flight Dynamics Officer reports that if
the burn is a reasonable one, that they would schedule mid-
course probably at 24 hours out, instead of 12 hours. That
would be an elapsed time of 4 hours. Stand by please.
P AO
And we expect communications to improve
a little bit after SIVB impact on the lunar surface; the SIVB
frequencey is giving us a little trouble with communications
after the impact we will not have to turn the transponder in
the spacecraft off, during handovers between tracking stations.
That's the situation as it stands now; we will keep you advised
as to Flight Director Lunney's availability. This is Mission
Control Houston.

elapsed time. We'll be passing up to the crew a procedure
shortly for them to perform a sun check in the alinement
optical telescope of the lunar module SO that we may better
understand what the present LM inertial platform alignment
is. If, as a result of this suncheck, the platform looks
good, we will perform the maneuver without a platform re-
alinement. If it does not look good and the limits on this
have been defined as plus or minus 1 degree, we will do what
is termed an earth-sun option alinement before going into
the dark behind the moon, and setup the attitude of the space-
craft so that the crew can mark on a good star while they're
in the dark to che ck the earth-sun alinement that they will perform

a little over 3 hours. That will be a detent 2, we'll have
a detail procedure up shortly and it will include a rendezvous
radar redesignation to get it out of the way and a P52 maneuver
to the attitude. It's our feeling that if that checks out
within 1 degree that your platform will be okay for the burn
without a subsequent P52. If it's not within 1 degree, we are
working up an earth/sun alignment procedure to align the plat-
form and we'll have that up to you later. Okay, assuming
that the sun check is okay, we will then give you a star for
a confidence on the backside during the darkness. We'll be
updating the burn pad to you prior to LOS going around the

Okay, Joe, as I read that at 74 hours
we're going to do a AOT sun check at descent 2, which is going
to require the rendezvous radar out of the way and we do P52
auto maneuver to get there, or at least the angles on to that,
and if this passes within 1 degree you're saying the platform
is okay for the maneuver and we won't need a subsequent P52.
But even if it is okay you'll give us a star which we can use
for our check when we're in darkness. If this check flunks,
you'll pass us on up then an earth/moon aline procedure.
CAP COM Okay, Fred, that's correct, except the
aline procedure we're working on is an earth/sun alinement,
and other than that that's correct. Incidentally, this PC
plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900 foot
per second maneuver and it will get you back to the mid-Pacific
line at 142 hours.
SC
Okay, that was an earth/sun check. We're
getting a little close to the moon now, and the PC plus 2 maneuver
still looks like about 900 foot per second to get us at mid-

CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. You ready with your G&N
diction aerial?
SC
Okay, I'm on page 34 now looking at P52.
CAP COM Okay Fred-o at the bottom of the page we
want step 1. From the flashing 0406 we want option 3 and
that'll pull us over to 6 and on the 5025 we want you to do
an enter on the 5025 and that'll bring up flashing 0170 and
load in R1 200. Over.
SC
Okay, let me see if I'm with you. We call
them P52 and on the flashing 0406 we pro on a 3 REFSMMAT which
leads us to a flashing 5025. We enter on that on the flash-
ing 0 170 we want to enter a 200.
SC
That's affirmative and after that you pro
on that and you come up with a flashing 0688 and we'll have
to load NO UN 88 and if you're ready to copy I have the sun
half unit vectors at 74 hours GET. Over.
CAP COM Okay. Go ahead.
SC
Okay, sun at half unit vectors. Next R1 is
plus 45498 Y plus 19024 Z plus 08250. Over.
CAP COM Okay. We pro on after entering the 200.
We'll get a flash in 0688, we then load the sun unit vectors
for 74 hours which are R1 plus 5 correction plus 45498,
R2 plus 19024, R3 plus 08250.
SC
Roger. That's good. Is that all? And that'll
bring you to step 8 and you get a flashing 5018 when you
prow on the NO UN 88. Okay, at 5018 we want to do an AUTO
maneuver to the attitude so just do the pro with the status
control PNGS, mode control PNGS to AUTO and we'll take up
the attitude and that's going to put us at - at attitude
for the sun check. Now we're being a 1.4 degree deadband
in this program in a docked configuration so to help you out
you could call VERB 62 to get your needles and when the
needles go through 0 or no out and in that deadband then you
take a look in the AOP and see how close the sun is and we
want within plus or minus 1 degree. Over.
SC
Ok ay so we have PRO on the NOUN 88 and we
end up with a flashing 5018 and you want an AUTO maneuver
rather than use the PTPA so we have PRO at the guidance
PNGS. Mode control AUTO. We've got a 1.4 degree deadband.
VERB 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and
at that time I looked through the AOP and if it's like
Apollo 11 sun check, all we've got to have is the sun
somewhere in the out there somewhere undecided as it passes,
is that correct?

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/14/70 CST 1:48P GET 72:35:15 247/1
SC
- somewhere in the cross there, some-
where under the sun, and it passes, is that correct?
CAP COM I think that is a little tight; that's
about a quarter degree; we could go a little bit out of that;
stand by one.
CAP COM Fred, we'll get you an answer on that one,
and also if you will stand by, we will give you a DAP load
for this maneuver. Over.
SC
Okay, we'll you'll give us the DAP load.
CAP COM
Right. Stand by.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston; Fred-o, to pass that
check, the sun is at - will set in an arc of one half degree
in the AOP, so you can be 2 diameters off and still pass the
check. Over.
SC
Okay, just half a degree, and so we can
be 2 sun diameters off and go past.
CAP COM That's affirmative. And we want you to
maneuver with a DAP of 2/10ths of a degree a second; over.
SC
Okay, you want us to use the DAP of 2/10ths.
CAP COM
Okay, that DAP load Fred-o is 31120; over.
SC
Okay, 31120.
CAP COM Rog. Now if we pass that check, you can
just terminate P52 right there, and we'll give you an atitude
to go to a burn attitude and from this we can get a star check,
if you don't pass, we would like you to do an alinement at
75 hours. And if you are ready to copy, we have some sun half
unit vectors and some earth half unit vectors at 75 hours; over.
SC
Stand by one.
CAP COM Okay, go ahead for 75 hours sun and earth
half unit vectors.

32120, R2 minus 34155, R3 minus 17370.
CAP COM Rog, Fred-o, good read back. Now on the
Earth, we estimate if you have to do this alinement, that the
Earth will be about a 2 degree turn, and it will be approximately
three quarters lighted. Now to mark on the Earth, we would like
you to take an imaginary line between the horns of the cresent,
and mark mid way between the horns. Over.
SC
Okay we got a 2 degree Earth three
quarter lighted and we are to imagine a line between the horns
of the Earth and mark right in the center of that line.
CAP COM That's affirmative. Now on this star
check correction - the sun check Fred, on the 5018 I got some
FEAI angles for you if you are ready to copy over.
SC
Okay, you are talking about the check at
74 hours GET right?
CAP COM Roger - okay, its 74 hours, when you start
this maneuver, the 5018 should look like R1 of 2703 degrees,
pitch R2 is 0903, and R3 of 2908 over.
SC
How about making all those 5 digit; readout
read them again Charlie.
CAPCOM Okay. Pardon me. It's 27030, 09030,
29080.
SC
Okay, the 5018 should look like R1 plus 27
030, R2 plus 09030, R3 plus 29080.
CAP COM Rog. Good read back. Now we got one more
procedure for you and right now we got the rendezvous radar
stowed and we won't be able to see anything out of detent 2,
so we would like you to position the radar to 0283 and we have
a procedure for that - and we would like you to do that right
before you get the attitude. Over.

Have you run a earth realinement on
the simulator with docking simulation.
CAP COM Is the question "Have we run an alinement
in the dock configuration?" That is affirmative.
SC
Okay. Did you have any trouble
controlling the vehicle and what techniques did you use?
CAP COM Briefly, to control PITCH and ROLL,
use the TCCA, as we've practiced, for YAW you can use the
ACA. Over.
SC
Okay. You have no special technique
going back and forth between the YAW and the X and Y lines.
Over.
CAPCOM Not right now, Jim. Dave Scott's been
running these things and we'll get them up to you shortly.
Over.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM We think the alinement's going to be
okay, so we don't have to do this P52 pull up alinement. We
think the check is going to be okay. Like to remind you since
you are in attitude, if check does not pass, since you are
in attitude for the sun that we want the sun half unit vectors
for us. Over.

Okay, Houston, Aquarius, we'd like
to know when you've had enough ranging so we can get the
power amp back up again.
CAP COM Roger, Fredo, we've got one more
procedure and we can shut it down and that's to get the
needles and the FDAI for this maneuver. That 5018 could
take you to gimbal lock and we think it's a good idea to
power up the Commander's ball. We've got a four stepper
if you're ready to copy. Over.

Apollo 13, Houston.
SC
13; go ahead.
CAP COM Jim, in a moment we will have an attitude
for you to go to and recommend that you keep your FDI up while
maneuvering to that attitude. After you get there, then we
will have you widen the dead band and eventually go into a
PTC about the burn attitude.
SC
You were cut off.
CAP COM Rog. We will have an attitude for you
to maneuver to in a moment. And you should leave your FDI up
for that.
CAP COM The attitude is as follows if you are ready
to copy; over.
SC
Got the book? Go ahead Vance.
CAP COM
Okay, this is FDAI attitudes for the
maneuver. Yaw 060 degrees, pitch 083 degrees, roll 272 degrees.
SC
Let's read that in the R1, R2. I don't
want VERB 69 twice. I want VERB 49, 58 (garble) so I can fly
the needle.
CAP COM
Jim. Those are not VERB 49 angles. Those
are strictly FDAI attitudes, over.
SC
Okay. I understand Vance. It's much
easier if the ball is up, to fly the needle, then that
would get to be a drift of VERB 49, 58 G maneuver. We could
fly that manually.
CAP COM Stand by. We'll try to get you the Verb 49
angles.

CAP COM
Fred, one point on the PTC requests
that about an hour or less from now when you make your
90 degree change that you do it in PGNCS AUTO as opposed
to AT HOLD. The reason is that if you're in an AT HOLD, it
establishes a new NO POINT each time you stop the maneuver
component.

Okay. You want us to make the
maneuver with PGNCS AUTO rather than the PGNCS AT HOLD. Is
that right?

Nothing else on page 14, proceed to page 15 and under RCS
checkout, we'd like to scratch that wording and just say
verify the following switches. Guidance control PGNCS,
step 3, correction, it's line 3 change attitude control 3
to mode control. Mode control both to AUTO. Verify ACA
prop, LMP enable, ACA 4 jet, LMP enable, TTCA translation
LMP, enable. That is all on page 15. Over.
SC
Okay. On page 15, we'll change the
heading RCS checkout to verify following switches and those
switches are guidance control PGNCS, third line attitude con-
trol 3 to mode control now, and then mode control both to
auto and ACA prop, LMP enable, ACA 4 jet, LMP enable,
TTCA translation, LMP enable.
CAP COM Roger. Now stand by one.
SC
Okay. Hand me the Ip's, I've got
Scorpio.

You have.
SC
Yes. In the Antares.

Where's the other one. I'll put it back
in here.
CAP COM Hello, Acquarius. Houston. On activation
page 16 if you are ready. OVer.
SC
Okay. Stand by just one, Charlie.

Jim is going to fish around. He thinks
he's got Scorpio. I'm the AOT now. Okay, Charlie, go ahead
I'm on 16 now.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 4:26P GET 75:13 275/1
CAP COM - to 25 degrees a second. Okay, proceeding
on down four more lines to balance couple, we'd like to turn
balance couple off, that's to keep the upfiring jets off of
the CSM; in case we have to damp any rates in AGS; though we
don't think we will. Then perform the rest of that page as
written. Over.
SC
Okay, on page 17. Do the AGS load at minus
4 minutes; it's CB11 inverter 2 closed; and scratch select
converter 1. Rate scale changed to 25 degrees a second.
Balance couple we'll turn to off; and incidentally, on the
AGS dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion we'd
had before Charlie on takeovers. You might discuss what it's
going to cost us DELTA-V wise, if we get a control problem,
to just shut her off and it take 30 minutes to regroup for
a good manual burn.
CAP COM Fred, we already got that story for you,
pretty well in hand. We're reviewing it right now. And I'd
like to defer that question until later on. Basically, we're
just going to shutdown and take what we got, and we got a
midcourse of about the maximum of 5 foot per second, any
where in the burn to get back to a free return. That that's
basically the story, we'll give you the mission rules for
this burn, momentarily. I'd like to proceed on to page 18,
at minus 1 minute, scratch MASTER ARM, ON. Standby.
SC
Okay, on page 18, and I've already done that
at 1 minute, MASTER ARM, ON; I'll scratch.
SC
Flip (garble) the way you do.
SC
I've already scratched and CB16 abort stage
closed for the previous burn.
CAP COM Okay. Now, we want you to close the CB 16
abort stage. Over.
SC
Okay. You got some special reason for that?
CAP COM Yes, sir. We'd like - in case we don't get
a manual ON - I mean, a auto, ON, we're going to backup using
the abort stage in the descent engine command override at a
ignition plus 1 second. Backing up to page 17, at minus
4 minutes; you read CB11 inverter 2, it should be CB16 in-
verter 2. Over.
SC
Okay, I got that, Charlie. 17, CB 16 in-
verter 2 closed.
CAP COM Okay, back to page 18. We'll continue on
as is at 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 7 seconds, minus 5 seconds.
At ignition, no ignition and we'll add here; no ignition
start pushbutton, push; still no ignition; descent engine
command override, ON. Over.
SC
Yes. I got out there, but I can't get this
hose (garble).
SC
Okay, channel on page 18, right on down the

start pushbutton push; still no ignition, keep the engine
command over at switch ON.

the LM Y-Z translation. Over.

Okay, scratch MASTER ARM, OFF at plus 15,
and an engine cutoff after mode control PGNCS, at HOLD, we
want a VERB 76; ENTER, and damp excessive rates via LM Y-Z
translation. And a question on the - propellant quantity, we
expect it to get down below a 37 percent on this burn and -

SC
We expect it to get down below that 37 percent
(garble).
CAP COM That's negative. In this burn we're
looking at not reaching 37 percent so I don't think we'll
have to perform that step but we will verify that for you.
Okay. One other step at engine cutoff. Get manual start
then at 30 feet per second to go throttle to 40 percent
at DELTA V equals zero stop pushbutton push. Over.
SC
At manual start that was throttle to 40 percent
at, was that 30 feet per second to go?
CAP COM
That's affirmative. 30 foot per second to go.
PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston,
SC
Stop push button at V going for zero?
CAPCOM That's affirmative. What we want to do,
if we got a manual start, we're going to have to shut down
manually and to get a better guided cutoff at 30 foot per
second to go, we want you to throttle a 40 and acceleration
is within reason there and we feel like we can get a good
manual cutoff. Over
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM Okay. Now, Fred, that was good in the
checklist. That's all. We'll have the power down checklist
for you momentarily and we'd like to ask you if you plan to
use the DPS burn for it. If you do, we have some changes
to that. Over.

abort stage open, AELD open CB16, AELD open.
CAP COM Okay. Good readback. Proceeding on
down the page. Balance couples switch, balance couple OFF.
Okay, down to the TTCA, the last line before minus 2 minutes.
TTCA commander throttle minimum, LMP TTCA to jets at minus
2 minutes, scratch 400 plus 1. At minus 1 minute scratch
master arm ON. At minus 10 seconds add manual ullage. At
plus 5 seconds scratch descent engine command override ON,
add TTCA 40 percent. Okay, the same comments apply about
the manual START. At the ignition time if no start, manual
start pushbutton push, there's still no start, descent
command engine override ON. And the same comments apply to
shutting down at manual start. Over.

about the no start, start push button push still no start,
descent engine MAN override on. That's a plus 5 second point,
scratch descent MAN override on and add TTCA to 40 percent and
the same comment applies at engine stop performing. Confirm.
CAP COM Confirm. Roger, Fred on that. We aren't
also at minus 30 seconds, we aren't looking at an AGS burn
so you can scratch, abort push button push, and at Delta V
equal to zero, scratch abort push button reset. Over.

Nunki in decant 2 at this time. Over.
SC
That's affirmative. I can see Nunki
in descent 2.
CAP COM
Okay, thank you. Roughly, in what
part of the field of view.
SC
Nunki is in the upper right hand corner.
CAPCOM
Okay. Thank you.
SC
And Scorp and Antares is barely visible
in the bottom of the field of view.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Yup, Jerry.

Hey, I bet - I know how I could get an
alignment.

Houston, for what it's worth, we can
probably give you a cursory mile angle on Nunki, and
possibly Antares or more than likely (garble).
CAPCOM Roger, Jim. According to our calculations
Nunki should be, at burn time, pretty close to the center
of the AOT. We've been talking that possibility over.

This is Apollo Control, Houston. 76
hours 30 minutes now. We show 13 at 2074 nautical miles
away.
SC
We're all set to go.
CAPCOM Okay. Okay, first of all, general
philosophy is these rules should be similiar to LOI code 1
abort would be tight limits. Now I'll go through them one
by one for you to copy. Okay, you should shut down if any
of the following
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 402 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 5:44P GET 76:31:00 288/1
CAP COM - Okay. You should shut down if any
of the following happen. Thrust monitor readout 77 percent
or below. DPS propellant tank pressure, that's inlet
pressure, onboard readout 160 or below. Fuel to 0X DELTA P
greater than 25 psi and that would have to be a ground call
to you. Attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees with the exception
of the start transient. Attitude rates limits plus or minus 10
degrees a second. And you should shutdown if you get any of the
following alarms: engine gimbal, ISS plus program alarm, LGC,
CES DC, and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters.
Are you with me?
SC
Roger.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
That will do.
CAP COM And proceeding on. If during the
burn the engine stops, give a flashing NOUN 97. You should
proceed then ullage. Engine start to PUSH, and descent
engine override ON. Okay, now this general information.
If you didn't burn PC plus 2, probably PC plus 4 would be
the earliest MCC. AGS is going to back up in a rate fail
mode only, which you know. We're talking over the star check.
Will have to get back with you on that. If, for some
reason, there is no PC-2, you have a free return trajectory
with the landing at 1520200 and that would be after a small
midcourse 5. Which would probably be around 4 feet per second
at 93 hours. And you have recovery forces in the Indian
Ocean you' re in good shape there. And the Indian Ocean
is where this landing would be. Okay. Still with me.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM Okay. After -
SC
Yeah. I'm with you.
CAPCOM
Okay. After PC-2, there are no
trim requirements and if you have a shutdown during PC plus
2, subsequent midcourse maneuvers required with well, the
earliest one would be PC plus 4.
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 403 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 5:49P GET 76:36 289/1
CAP COM - it would Well, the earliest one would be
EC plus 4. If you don't do a PC plus 2, but we still want
to do one MCC later, at PC plus 4 the increase in Delt -
DELTA-V or the penalty would be about 24 feet per second.
With a landing in the mid-Pacific at 142:46:30. Now, you
should expect new pads, state vectors, and targets for PC
plus 2 at about GET 78. Over.
SC
(Garble) standby. Standby, Vance.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, how do you read?
CAP COM
Loud and clear.
SC
(Garble).
SC
Okay, burn roll, I was to shutdown for the
following: if we have the thrust monitor at 77 percent or
below. Number 2, if the DPS propellant ullage pressure is
less than 160 psi. 3, if the fuel oxidizer DELTA-P is greater
than 25 and that'll be a ground call out. 4, if the attitude
error is plus or minus 10 degrees except for starting transients.
SC
Okay, rate limits are plus or minus 10 degrees
per second. And we're to shutdown with the following ALARMS:
an engine gimbal light, an ISS with a program alarm, an LGC,
a CESDC, and an inverter light if it's still on after we've
tried switching inverters. If during the burn the engine
shuts down when the NO UN 97 flashes we should proceed and do
manual ullage and start pushbutton push, and descent engine
command override, open. If we don't do a PC 2 our next
burn will it be at - PC 4 for an added 24 foot per second,
we'll land mid-Pac at 142:46:30. Okay, we'll have the AGS
up for backup rate command, or rate damp rates, I guess.
And the free return that we're on, if we don't - that we're
on now if we don't do PC 2 or 4, lands us at 152:02:00 in
the Indian Ocean. And there's no trim requirements on this
burn, and we should expect a new uplink at a new final maneu-
ver pad from you at 178 hours.

fashion, going through that two-hour activation generally took
somewhere from about an hour and 15 to an hour and 20.
CAPCOM Okay. Then I guess we ought to allow you
a little more than that, eh?
SC
I was thinking that since we don't have
to do about four pages of it, that we probably would need just
about that and that will make up for the difference of any
added time we need maneuvering, etc.

is the power amp with an off, and the last word on that line
is off, replace it with TCM. Fourth line is okay. Fifth
line scratch the whole line. Lighting, we haven't needed
flood yet so we will just leave them off, exterior lighting
off. Scratch line 2 and on by now on power 6 wait for your
update on the CB panels
CAP COM Okay. Power 6. Okay, power 6 refers to
panel 11. You should go per the chart with the exception of
those breakers that I call out. First line is okay. Or,
lets say, first row. Second row quad 4 TCA closed, quad 3
TCA closed, quad 2 TCA closed and quad 1 TCA closed. The
rest of that row is okay. Row 3 about half-way over at
ATCA PGNCS closed. Okay, the rest of that line is okay. Fourth
line heater. Stand by. Okay, that line is all okay with
the exception of the last three circuit breakers, Fred. Under
PCNGS which is LGC DSKY, IMU stand by and IMU operate. Those
three should be closed. At least for the time being. Finally,
the fifth line it's okay as is. And would you give me a
readback on that.

Okay, I disagree on the fifth line. It
appears that we ought to have the ascent ECA control open.
CAPCOM Okay, we'll check into that one while
we are listening to the rest of your readout.
SC
Okay, top row is correct as is. Second
row we want the quad TCA's one through 4 closed. On the
third row we want the ATCA PCGNS closed. On the fourth row
we want the PGNCS LGC DSKY, IMU stand by and IMU operate
all closed, and you stand the bottom row as is.

CAP COM Okay. I'll get back with you on your
question in a minute, Fred. Now here comes the PTC procedure.
Step 1, guidance control to PGNCS, 2, mode control att hold.
VERB 76 enter, maneuver to PTC attitude, and that incidentally
is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw, we realize you can't
monitor that on your FDAI, but you can on a VERB, with a
VERB 16, NOUN 20. With me?
SC
Rog. Guidance control PGNCS, mode
control att hold, VERB 76, enter, maneuver to PTC attitude
which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw which is the present yaw.
Is that correct?
CAPCOM That's correct. Okay, next. Mode - -
when you're established at the attitude mote control auto.
Key in Verb 16 NOUN 20 to monitor rates, when less that 1
degree a second, rate in all, in each, axis then disable
plus X thrusters. Okay, next VE RB 25, NO UN 07 enter. 1257
enter. 252 enter 1 enter VERB 77 enter VE RB 48 enter put
in the DAP 22110 and proceed. VE RB 34 enter, then VE RB 26
NOUN 20, and monitor rates. On rates less than .01 degrees
per second in all axis, VERB 76 enter. Mode control at
hold, then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maneuver.
Over.
SC
Okay, Vance. PTC procedure, quidance
control PGNCS, mode control att hold. VE RB 76 enter,
maneuver to PTC attitude, roll 0, pitch 90, yaw 0, my ball now
of course is inoperative, SO I'll have to get that on the
DSKY. The 5 is mote control auto, 6 VERB 16, NOUN 20
monitor rates. Rates less that 1 degree per second in each
axis disable and I didn't hear that last part. The next
one was VE RB 25 NO UN 07 enter 1257 enter 252 enter 1 enter.
VE RB 77 enter VERB 48 enter

enter, Verb 16 NOUN 20 enter, monitor rates. Rates less than
.01 degrees per second in all axis. VERB 36 enter, load
control att hold, then. 30 clicks of right yaw to stop maneuvers -
start maneuvering.
CAP COM Roger. That's correct, Jim. To answer
your questions and correct one point, YAW should be your
present YAW whatever it is and that's up with ROLL zero, PITCH
90 present YAW. The other thing is you said disable and you
didn't hear the rest. That's disable plus X-thrusters. And,
finally, near the end the 22110 refers to DAP loading.
SC
Roger. Now maneuver to PTC and ROLL zero,
PITCH 90 (garble) YAW whatever YAW is. Okay, Vance, in our
initial maneuver to PTC attitude, I am going to have to use
the display 1620 and I'll have to use the TTCA to get there.
CAP COM Jim, Roger, you're still in TTCA and
just a reminder that in maneuvering that ROLL is in R3 and
the YAW is in R1.
SC
That's affirmative and I'm going to take
our ROLL first to get it zero and then I'm going to take care
of PITCH.

you can use the TTCA's to maneuver, but you're going to save
a lot of fuel if you'd try minimum impulse. So, that might
be a better recommendation. The other thing is, we'd like
to give you a GO before you disable the plus S - X thrusters,
and before you do a VERB 76, and mode control 2 at HOLD. Over.

Okay, understand. You want a GO before I -
I'm - of course, I just hit a 76, and the mode control isn't
at HOLD, at this time. But, let's put her on, now.
CAP COM Yes, all we wanted to do was take a look at
things before you disabled the plus X thrusters, and before
you go to MIN impulse at the end there. That VE RB 76; ENTER,
mode control at HOLD.

Ah -
CAP COM
Go ahead.
SC
- in what fashion did you want us to disable
those plus X thrusters? Just pulling those appropriate PTA
breakers, or did you want to actually go in and mask those
jets?
CAP COM Okay, Fred, we didn't explain that. The
VERB 25, NOUN 07; ENTER sequence does that.
SC
Okay, I didn't read the whole procedure, Jim
just mentioned he wanted to disable plus X.

And, Vance, are you still trying to get me
an answer on that pulling that ASA breaker?

That's affirm, Fred. This word here is,
pull it.

Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM
Okay, just some info. We're working
up a procedure for you to use to use command module LI OH
canisters to connect to your hoses, the outlet hoses in the
LM so as time passes in the mission, you can continue scrubbing
the LM atmosphere. And this whole thing requires that a
modifying a kit SO that you can attach the hose, you're
modifying a LI OH cansiter so you can attach the hose to it.
So, some time in the future we will be coming up to you
with that procedure. Second point. Second point is we're
standing by to watch your maneuver for the PTC procedure.
SC
Okay. I'm in process now, Vance, of
maneuvering to 0 yaw, 90 degree pitch using the LM mode.
CAPCOM
Okay.
SC
And Vance, I assume it has also been
thought of that we got two extra secondary cartridges. One
in each PLSS.
CAP COM
Roger.

We better start working on that

CAP COM Yes. We wish we could send you a kit
and it would be kind of like putting a model airplane together

What are we make it out of Vance.
CAP COM
One canister with a plastic roof.

Just for your information, Houston,
during, just prior to going around the moon, we saw a

Well, I don't see any way around it, Jim.
SC
It sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does
it?

It won't go down.

Not at all, wonder if they tried that in the

on me, no matter how I hit the controllers.
SC
Good pitch, Joe.
SC
It might be a change in rate.

I'd like to move this yaw around, see if it'll

CAP COM
Jim, we don't have any data on your movements
right now. How does it look like this procedure's going to
work out SO far as getting an attitude set up, the first
part of the procedure?
SC
Well, Vance, I've been trying to use a bit
of (garble) attitude control to get my roll and yaw -
the roll and pitch, rather. But with the attitude control
rolling in this configuration, I - I can't command these
to roll the way I want to, so I had to go to DPCA to get my
roll to build up towards zero, it was going decreasing
towards 270. I really don't know what the combination
is in the attitude control, that you can get the control to
pitch and roll the way you want it to. You've got to use
the DPCA.
CAP COM
Roger, copy.
SC
(Garble).
SC
I now have both pitch and yaw or pitch
and roll going toward the designated amounts, now passing

and I'm going up past 321 degrees in ROLL
and I am letting it go that direction and when I get there and
when I get there 90 in pitch and zero and zero in ROLL, I'll go
to AUTO and damp the rate. Get a little sleep? That's okay.
SC
We've got to rig up a method of using those
lithium hydroxide cannisters.

Jim, we're going to have to get back
with you in a couple of minutes on that. We switch over
at this time to your other cannister. A second point, it
might help in setting up this PTC if you concentrate on ROLL
first and get that going and then work on PITCH when ROLL is
established and sort of take whatever YAW you get.
SC
Okay. Vance, I tried that but when I
start doing ROLL only I get pitch coupled in with it.

Oh boy. (garbled) He didn't want it.
There she goes, okay.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Vance.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. Since the first recommendation
on how to maneuver PTC didn't work out, we have another one.
And you might try this. Put yaw at 0, then start on the roll
and the pitch after that.
SC
Vance, do you read.
CAP COM
Yes. I do now. Go ahead.
SC
Okay. You want to - what sort of material
you had in mind to build this mailbox out of and Jack and
I will go to work on trying to construct this thing. Assume
we will use the space-age baleing wire or the grey tape.
CAP COM That's afirm. We have a lengthy
procedure here, but in short, you use plastic as a covering
for the whole thing. You put some kind of a stiffener at
the top so the plastic doesn't suck against the LOI LIOH
entrance side. You need grey tape to stick the whole thing
together and you need something like a sock to put in the
bottom so that the outlet side is plugged up. As it turns
out the flow is rather U-shaped through this cartridge, Fred.
It, if you plug up the bottom it comes in one side of the
top and goes out the other.
SC
Okay. Hold on a minute. Let us go
get a cartridge and when we get it in the hand, I'll speak to
you some more.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, over.
SC
Okay, Vance, go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. Really, I think we should give
you a more detailed procedure on that and in general,
those are the materials that are to be used, but let us
get back with detailed procedure on how to make this cartridge
arrangement work.
SC
Okay. And to answer your question about
PTC we have difficulty in yawing zero (garble). We not sure -
yaw is working toward zero right now. Pitch is working toward
90 roll is working toward zero. So we're we did need take some
time to get there, that's all.

Apollo 13 at 10 431 nautical miles out from the Moon. It's
velocity reading 4 649 feet per second. A couple of points
of clarification: the master alarm on the C02 canister
was expected to occur at some point in the mission. It is
normally set at 7.6 millimeters of C02. This number chosen
as an alert to watch the canisters. However, the medical
officials had agreed -
SC
It's complete.
PAO
- medical officials had agreed that it
would be desirable to raise this number on our return to
15 millimeters in order to preserve the lifetime on the
canisters. Here at MSC, the level in laboratory testing
has -
SC
- 15, 20.
P AO
Here in the MSC laboratories the levels
using test subjects have been as high as 22 millimeters of
C02 with no ill effects. On our passive thermal control
we have damped the rates at this point. There has been an
effort on the part of the crew and the ground to perform
this activity with minimum use of the RCS propellants. We're
at 81 hours 21 minutes.

Maybe sort of think about rationing some of it. I
mean just to make sure we've got enough to last us until we

easier to give up.
PAO
This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 81
hours 45 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 presently
115 11 587 nautical miles away from the Moon and travelling
at a velocity of 4 600 feet per second.
SC
Oh, that's right. That blasted Service
Command Module is back there. (garbled)
SC
That one?
SC
It's not much better. (garbled)
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
SC
Go ahead.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM
Jim, we have some status information
for you, if you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper.
SC
Standby, Vance.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
We're ready for you. Let's get away and
get this status paper here. Go ahead, Vance.
CAP COM Okay. The first midcourse correction
will probably be at GET 104 hours and all we look for is
a 4 to 6 feet per second DELTA V. Okay, that's the first
item. Now, I will give you a run down on consumables.
Okay, in the LM, you have 1 498 that is 1 4 9 8 amp-hours
remaining. That means over 61 hours you - that would average
out to 24.5 amps. We expect that after power down, that
you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that would leave
a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the end of the mission. Are you
with me?
SC
Roger. We're with you. That's what

CAP COM
Okay. In the LM, you -
SC
We're with you.
CAP COM
In the LM, you have 215 that is 2 1 5
pounds of water usable. That would average out over 61
hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available. Okay.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-14-70 CST 11:01P GET 81:48:00 322/1
CAP COM Okay. And after you power down, we
expect that you will be using water at the rate of 3.2
to 2.7 pounds - that's at 14 amps per hour electrical
usage rate. One note, this down not when we speak here
of water avaiable, this does not include CSM water and PLSS
water, so that's added on. Okay. Next. LiOH. Using the
CSM cans you will have 16 cans at 12 hours per can to give
you 192 or 192 hours of LiOH. And in the LM using it's
cans you have 44 hours remaining.
SC
Vance, is that with the PLSS seconda-
ries.
CAP COM That's affirm. That's affirm. That
includes PLSS secondaries. Okay. Oxygen. You have remaining
44 pounds in the LM. At a usage rate of .36 pounds per
hour that leaves you 120 or one two zero hours of oxygen.
Okay. Next. RCS. RCS A stands at 62 percent and B at
62 percent. We only expect 2 percent to be used for the
PTC so you're in good shape for RCS. Next DPS DELTA A.
You have 1190 feet per second remaining. And finally CSM
EPS. We estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. That's an
estimate. And that's it. Over.
SC
Okay. I copy.
CAP COM Okay. and just a question. It would
be interesting to hear from Jack to see if he thinks that
main B bus is good. if he has any idea of whether it's
good or not, this would influence our steps in the future.
For example, we might want to try to test main B to see if
it is in fact good so that we'd know how to set switches for
entry.
SC
Okay. Just a minute. They want to
know if you think main bus B is any good for the command
module. Now, while Jack's got on the loop, let me pose the
question of how we're going to do this midcourse if we're
going to power down the (garbled).
CAP COM Would you stand by on that, Jim. We'd
like to give you a procefure for that later on.
SC
Okay. (garbled talk to crewmembers)
He's going to give us a procedure on that later on.
CAP COM In short, Jim, we don't expect any
problem, but we'll explain later on.
SC
Okay.

says you've been working hard and you've got to relax a little
bit and be ready for tomorrow.
SC
Vance, this is Jack.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Jack.
SC
Okay. Let me give you my observations
on main bus B. They tabbed us pretty fast there and we
first heard the impact or explosion or whatever caused
it. I'm not sure. The next about 1 second later there
was a master alarm which was the main bus B undervolt. I
looked at the voltage and the voltage was good at this time
so I'm suspecting it was right. Fuel cell 3 was also good
with good flow. However, Fred, at that point, was coming
into the command module and got over into his seat. At that
time, we shortly had an ac bus 2 right about the time he
got in his seat. He looked at the main bus B and the main
bus B was reading zero. However, - and the fuel cell flows
were zero. I'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do have
a current main bus B. But that's merely a guess. I never
did try to reset it. We were having other problems with
the main bus A, having an under volt and a few other things like
that. I'd kind of like to hear what your feelings are down
there.
CAP COM Well, Jack, we copy your information.
And we'd like to hold off cause we're still working your
problem. So we will have to give you information later.
Thank you.
CAP COM
Aquarius, request capped OMNI.
SC
Vance, are you back with me?
CAP COM
Rog. We're with you.
SC
Okay. We lost lock there. We switched
OMNI's. Just for my own kind of to get my thoughts together
I'd like to hear what kind of entry you're planning. EMS
or PNGS or what?
CPACOM Okay. PNGS entry is being planned
and people are at work on checklist changes and that sort
of thing.
SC
Okay. Real fine.
CAP COM
And we'll give you a CSM stuff
tomorrow but basically we expect that main bus B is good and
we're trying to work up a procedure to test it.
SC
Okay. Those are my thoughts too.
CAP COM
Rog.
SC
You think main bus B is good, don't
you?

CAP COM That's affirmative. Pull active
PNGS open.
SC
Okay. I've done that.
CAP COM
Okay. Are you ready for the fourth
row?
SC
Affirm.
CAP COM
Okay. Now when we get in the fourth
row, we're going to open the IMU operate circuit breaker.
And what that means is that we're going to lose the capability
to watch your CDU's, so we're not going to be able to see
your attitude. Therefore, we will not be able to advise
you which antenna to select for communications. The way we
want you to handle that is to turn the LM uplink squelch
off and when you hear the noise, switch antennas. We'll
be able to see you switch antennas and it's going to take
us about 3 to 5 minutes to establish a lock-on again after
you switch. After each time you switch antennas we will
initiate a voice check. And basically when you see the earth
out the window you can be on forward antenna and when the
moon's in the window use the aft antenna. You copy?
PAO
That's Jack Lousma on the capsule
communicator position.
SC
We're going to pull the IMU operate
circuit breaker, so you won't be able to see our attitude.
Therefore, you won't tell us how to switch antennas and will
enable - turn the squelch off so that when we start getting
any static we'll switch antennas and as a thumb rule we
could use with the earth forward we use the forward antenna
and when we see the moon we use the aft antenna.
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. In other
words, we're leaving the antenna switching up to you and
after you switch antennas its going to take 3 to 5 minutes
for us to establish a lock-on again and we'll initiate a
voice check. And I'm ready to go on panel 11 row 4.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. On row 4, under heaters RCS
system AB SET-1. Open quads 1 through 4. Under ECS the only
change is under glycol pumps close auto trenafer. Under
COMM the only change is open vhf A receiver, open COMMANDER
AUDIO. Under PNGS the only change is close and leave closed
IMU standby circuit breaker SO we can have heaters. Read
back.
SC
Okay. Row 4, we're going to open all
four of the heaters. The RCS system ( garbled) the first
four circuit breakers. We're going to close the auto trans-

We got low-bit rate TM. However, we don't have any VHF.
We have CWEA. We have Glycol Pumps. We have Suit Fans.
We have cabin repress for you, and standby in attitude control
here. Ok ay in attitude control we'll have hard overs for
uses in emergency and for normal usage we want to have a
15 minute delay to get the heaters on. To warm them up
before use. How do you read?
SC
Okay. For emergency we have hard overs
and normal use it requires a 15 minute request to get the
heaters on.
CAP COM That's affirmative. Ok ay Jim, that
concludes our power down procedure, and we're waiting for
you to get with it.

of the star field it's created for us. There are about a thousand
little sparklies out here.
CAPCOM Okay, so you're seeing some venting out
window 1 and you saw a 4 inch square piece of loose metal
which was silver in - are you still seeing the venting? Or has
it zeroed out now?

SC
I don't know. I left upstairs down in
the LM now, Jack. I guess when Jack goes up he can take
a look and let me know. Okay, I'll think about switching AFT
here directly. I see the Moon, and the Moon looks pretty good
Jack so I guess that PTC still doing pretty good.
CAP COM Okay, and we won't have any Comm delay
if the PTC stays good.
Yes, sure enough the Moon is getting
smaller.
CAP COM Good, and we want to ask you another
question about the venting. Is this Would you suppose some
new venting or is this venting that you just hadn't that's
been going on all the time, but which you hadn't looked at
recently?
SC
I can't really say, Jack, we've been so
tied up down in the LM, I guess we kind of forgot about the
other half, but I've been upstairs several times and hadn't
continually noticed any flow by the windows before, so my
first assumption was that it was new venting. It really
wasn't very heavy.
CAPCOM Okay. Copy. Thank you.
SC
And Jack is going up to take a look
now.
CAP COM Okay. For your information all of our
numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. We're using
only 12.3, so we're a little bad on our analysis.
SC
Very good way to be.
CAPCOM
And we're in a -
SC
Aquarius has really been a quite a winner.
CAP COM Well, that's one of several. We want to
tell you something that I told Jim earlier, and that concerns
control. Right now you have control and hard over if you
need it, but when we go to some normal control modes, it's
that we have the Quad heaters off. We want to have a 15
minute notice for attitude control request. Over.
SC
Okay, Jack. Off hand I can't imagine
that since we got the platform powered down why we need to
worry about the instantaneous control, but at any rate, we
need 15 minutes warm up with the heaters before we can start
using thrusters.
CAP COM
Right.

SC
- but at any rate we need 15 minutes warmup
with the heaters before we can start using thrusters.
CAP COM Right. And another thing we've done is to
pull your ECS and EPC display breakers and so we - but we
brought your caution warning powered up. So if you get
ECS type or EPS caution and warning you're not to power up
those meters with the display breakers. And we are watching
for you. Your PIPA temperatures, your ASA temp, your pro-
pellant temperatures except for the DPS propellant, and
we're watching your QUAD temps for you.
SC
Okay. That's very good, Jack. You're
watching them. That's good enough.
CAP COM And everybody's fine at home EL LAGO.
SC
Great.
CAP COM And, Fred, your C02 is building up. It's
at 11.3 on our gage, and we've got a medical buildup at
15 millimeters at which time we'll switch over to secondary.
Looks like we've got plenty of lithium hydroxide. About
192 hours including the CSM cartridges. And as you know,
we've got a way to use those. As soon as we get them
written in some good words, we'll pass that along. You
might be able to make one.
SC
Okay. Yeah, we'll sure give her a try.
And I'm showing onboard about 12 and a half millimeters of
Mercury.
CAPCOM Roger. And I have a flight plan update
when you get time to copy sometime, I'11 pass it along.
There's no hurry on it.
SC
Okay. Stand by one. Jack's back now.
SC
Okay. Jack just came back and he said it's
still coming out and it's only coming out on the commanders'
side. So he s aw it out the same window I did, window one, and
it's between the minus Y and minus Z axis.
CAP COM Okay. And I -
SC
That way the service module which was my
impression, too.
CAP COM Okay. So you're sure it's service module
and of course if anyone is interested in knowing is it's
something that is residual from before or is it something
new. If you have any ideas about that why we'd sure like
to have them.
SC
(garbled)
SC
Yeh, Jack, I'll answer your question in a
minute, but make that first impression here is that it's not
nearly as intensity it was right after our (garbled) pass and
I'll have to agree with that. He said it was a half and I said it
was maybe down to a third. And, Houston, I'd like to
know if you have any pressures (garbled) residual from
that or maybe something new.

--- PAGE 464 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 12:05A GET 83:02 332/2
SC
I don't know why I felt that. Yeah, I felt
it was (garbled) venting through.
CAPCOM Okay. Switch to forward option.
CAP COM Fred, if you think it's practical, we're
ready to give you some - we're working on some camera settings
for pictures of the venting. And if you have a camera out
and ready to go, let us know which one it is SO we can get
the sightings for that camera. What do you think about that?
SC
Okay. Jack got the one with the 250 milli-
meter lense on it. That's the standard EL. And I have a
(garbled) that I've been shooting hundreds of
Earth-Moon pictures with, camera one. And we also have the
reneau upstairs that's pretty handy. The command module
DC camera.
CAPCOM Okay. I copy -
SC
- take your choice.
CAP COM I copy the 250 millimeter, the razo is (garbled),
available, but I didn't get what other one is.
SC
Okay. I got my Hassalblad service camera
down in the LM here handy, too, camera one.
SC
And, Jack, if we're going to do any pictures
taking out the command module windows, I think we'd better
do that pretty quick or hold up till Jim and Jack gets
their rest done.
CAP COM We cuncur with that.
CAP COM Okay, Fred, we're not going to bother the
skipper up there. We won't be taking any pictures out of
the command module window until after rest period.
SC
Okay.

This is Apollo Control at 83 hours
2 minutes. Fred Haise has the watch at the present time in
the lunar module, while Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert attempt
to get some rest in the command module. The flight plan
calls for a five hour rest period for both the commander and
the command module pilot. A re-capping briefly - Fred Haise
remarks after coming back to the LM from the command module
where he had been getting something to eat. Fred reported
that he had observed some venting apparently from the service
module and had also seen a four inch square piece of metal
which he described as silver in color float by the window
of the command module. He was looking out the number one
window, which is viewed from inside the command module -
is the window to the left of the commander's couch, the far
left window. Haise was asked if he felt the venting was some-
thing new or if it was residual venting from the original
event which had caused the loss of power and oxygen to the
service module. He did not know and we also have not deter-
mined here on the ground whether this was an event associated
with the original loss of power from the service module or
whether it is something new. That's being evaluated at this
time. Haise said he did feel definitely that the event was
coming from the service module that the piece of metal he
had seen floating by was from the service module and that
the venting was from the service module. Flight director
Milton Windler, after reviewing the situation, elected to
wait until after the commander, Jim Lovell, and the command
module pilot Jack Swigert had completed their rest period
before attempting to get back into the command module and
photograph the venting and whatever pieces might be visible
out the window.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 83 hours
11 minutes. A change of shift press briefing is being
planned to being in about 10 minutes at 12:35 am in the
main auditorium at the Houston New Center. The participants
in the press conference will be flight director Gene Kranz
and astronaut Tony England. And repeating the time for
that change of shift briefing is tentatively planned for
12:35 am about ten minutes from now.
CAP COM Okay. Fred, for your information,
your C02 reading on board is a little higher than what we're
reading here on the ground, and so when it gets to 15
on your meter, switch to secondary. And we'd like to get a
status about every thirty minutes we'll give you a call
on that. But just to let you know we're still thinking
about you, we'd like you to go bio-med right, please.
SC
Okay. Going bio-med right.

SC
Ok. My C02 reading is now just below 13.
CAPCOM
Say again what it is.
SC
It's just a trace below 13.
CAP COM
Okay. Just below 13. Just for your infor-
mation we've got people working on several subjects. We're
working on the midcourse coming up, to determine our control
system--how to do it with the control system we select,
what we should do about the alignment -- we've got the
(garble) and several crews cranked up working on that, and
we're also working on our entry, how and when we ought to
activate the CSM and we're working on the CSM systems status.
Tomorrow sometime we're going to have a main bus B checkout,
so we've got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and
I've got some F-stop settings for you for the lunar surface
camera. At 1/250 we'd like you to take targets of opportunity.
Each picture use three F-stops, because we don't know exactly
which one is going to work the best, so use 4, 5.6, and 8
and 1/250 for the surface camera. Got it?
SC
Okay. Use the surface camera at 1/250 4, 5.6,
and 8. And I've been doing quite a bit of shooting at 5.6,
and 8. (Garble)
CAP COM Roger, I didn't catch that last part. Maybe
when the COMM gets a little better you can say again.
SC
Okay. How do you read now, Jack?
CAP COM
That's a lot better, Fred.
SC
Okay, I just said the moon is awfully bright,
that I think the higher range of F-stops would be better.
F/8 and maybe F/11.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
I can just barely on the left corner of the
Moon now make out the foothills of (garble) formation. We
never did get to see it when we were in closer.
CAP COM Okay. I'm reading on my monitor here, Fred,
that you're 16 214 miles away from the moon moving at about
4500 feet per second.
SC
From the souds of all the work that is going
on and is still going on, this flight is probably a lot
bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.
CAP COM Yeah, you've been working it out a little
bit.
SC
You guys have really got a tough job right
now switching OMNIS.
CAP COM Well, everybody down here is 100 percent
optimistic. Looks like we're on the up side of the whole
thing now.
SC
Yeah, I guess we had better be in good
shape, particularly ourselves rested for entry day. I
think that is going to be a pretty busy one.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 12:47A GET 83:34:00 335/1
CAP COM How's it going Fred?
SC
Okay. Just fine.
CAP COM Okay. We're considering a vent course
correction at 104 hours about 20 hours from now, 18 hours from
now, and it's only 7 feet per second. The other option is to
keep PTC up since we may not be able to get back into it again,
and delay it. So, that's the kind of thing we're thinking
about would - just wanted to let you know that pretty much
right in the middle of the fairway there and a present tracking
with no midcourse as you - with a Gamma of 7.11 as opposed
to 6.51. So, you're already in the corridor. You're just
a half a degree between the center and the outer limit and
we're going to tweek that up.
SC
Okay. That sounds good.
CAP COM And we don't - we think there might have
been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable water. Don't
worry about drinking water. You can drink all you want. There's
plenty of it. There's 38 pounds, and the surgeon recommends
that you use some of the fruit juices as well. Over.
SC
Okay. Yes. We went up and used the
procedure pressurize first tank, and Jack and I made up a
total of 22 drinking (garbled) of water.
CAP COM Okay. And I assume Jack is up there
sleeping now too. Right?
SC
Yes. That's right. They're both up
there. I hate to say it Jack, but I think our PTC is about
to wobble off a little bit. I noticed that the earth is
coming by somewhat lower than the windows and the moon is
going by somewhat higher.
CAP COM Okay. Understand. PTC, earth is coming
by lower and moon is coming by higher.
SC
Yes.
CAP COM And Fred on this rigged command module
aluminum hydroxide canaster, what we're going to do is we're
going to have to make at least two up and use two at a time.
One on each set of hoses. What we'll do is we'll connect
one of the jury rigged boxes to the red fittings and air will
be sucked through the lithium hydroxide and then blown out
the blue fitting. And we're also going to, when we do this,
remove the LM lithium hydroxide canaster from the suit loop,
either the primary or the secondary, and we're getting the works
together to make it easy to build one of these things, and it
looks like it will probably take two guys so, I think we
probably ought to plan to that later. In addition, we have
to go up and get a couple of canasters out of the command
module SO it looks like maybe a smart idea would be to delay
a little bit and have you build a couple of these later on.
What do you think?

--- PAGE 470 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 12:47A CET 83:34:00 335/2
SC
Yes. I agree Jack. Jack Swigert and
I went up ther earlier and both got a canaster, and we were
scratching around some material and think about using them,
and that's actually why we're wondering what made up all the
water to drink because we needed the plastic container that
they were housed in in the pantry, and think that that's ready
to use plus some material plus some extra porous bags
that were used for the dump control that we may just cut up
for (garbled) to.
CAP COM Did you come up with a design -
SC
Did we get what?
SC
No. We just thought we'd see what we
had in the way of material and stand by for your word. Of course,
we also have lots of stiff backed cardboard from flight data.
CAP COM Yes. We've decided to use a canaster
and, you know that the liquid cool garment has a bag around
it that we think we can use too, we know we can use. We've
tried it. So, what you have is the bag within a bag and inside
that is a liquid cool garment. The bag that is closest to the
liquid cool garment is the one we mean, and we've got 2 of them,
and then of course, we've got to use the, some -
CAP COM - flight data file timeline book or something
like that, and just using those materials we can make this
jury rigged canaster. So, the bag that we're looking for is
the one that is right next to the liquid cool garment and
if we're very careful about where we cut it we can make a
very good rig.
SC
Okay. It looks like we'll have to use
that bag over again though, because we only have 2 of them,
and I expect that we'll have to make more than 2 of these
canasters up.
CAP COM
Roger.

Fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going
to hand you over to a different communications site, and
it's going to take us about a minute or SO to reestablish
uplink, so you can be prepared for that.

you read?
SC
Loud and clear, Jack.
CAP COM
Same here.
SC
Roger. Coming in a little louder.
CAP COM
Fred, you'll have to say again. Can't
read you there. There's too much background noise. OK. (garbled)
SC
Okay, I'm on the other OMNI now. You're coming
in even louder then previously.
CAP COM Roger. Maybe it's because it's standing
up. You're coming in better now too.
SC
For your information, Jack, I'm just
going to prepare some beef and gravy and other assorted
goodies.
CAP COM I presume that you're doing this with
the full permission of the Commander.
SC
At the moment, who do you think is the
Commander?
CAP COM
If I was him, I'd make you sign out
everything you ate so I'd know.
SC
(garbled) Incidentally, this PTC
must have a wobble mode around our X-axis (garbled) SO now the
Moon and Earth are back in the right perseective.

way.
CAP COM
These guys down here are saying they
knew it all the time.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 84 hours
8 minutes. During the change of shift briefing, CAP COM
Jack Lousma kept up a fairly constant stream of communication
with Fred Haise who is on-duty -
PAO
- who is on duty in the Command Module
in the Lunar Module rather. I would like to recap for
you some of the things that were discussed during that
period of time. Lousma advised Haise that the mid-course
correction being considered at this time is a 7 foot per
second maneuver which would occur at 104 hours. The other
option which -
CAP COM
Sometime when you're not too busy chewing

--- PAGE 472 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/15/70, CST 1:09A, GET 83:56:00, 336/2
CAP COM
- how about telling us what the C02 is?
SC
Okay, I'm reading 13 - 13.
CAP COM
Okay, it looks like I read and it's getting
kind of close to yours.
PAO
Lousma discussed with Fred Haise the
options that we have on that mid-course correction at 104
hours. The other option being to delay the mid-course
correction. If that were done, it would not be necessary
to stop the passive thermal control mode which the Lunar
Module is in at this time. That is being considered but
no decision has been made. The carbon dioxide levels in
the Lunar Module were also discussed and a procedure was
passed up to Haise for keeping tabs on the rising C02 level,
and for changing to the backup lithium hydroxide canister
when the level reaches 15 millimeters of mecury - partial
pressure. The surgeon also recommended that the onboard
reading be used for this indication. It was felt that the
onboard reading would be somewhat more accurate although we've
been reading about the same thing on the ground as Haise
has been reporting from the spacecraft, and at last report
the level of C02 was at about 13. At one point Haise reported
that the passive thermal control appeared to be degrading
a bit. Said that everytime the spacecraft rotated one complete
revolution, the Earth would appear to be a bit lower in the
window, and the Moon appeared to be moving higher in the
window. I believe you heard Haise report later that there
may have been some sort of a wobble in the passive thermal
control and that the Earth and Moon were now back in the
proper position in the windows. So that's another area that
we'll continue to watch, and see how the passive thermal
control mode maintains itself. We've also had a communications
hand-over. Handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone,
California to the tracking site at Honeysuckle Creek, Australia.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-15-70 CST 1:27A GET 84:14:00 337/1
SC
Yes. It appear the wobble on the
other way, Jack, because the earth is now rising and the
moon is starting to lower in the window.
CAP COM Roger. Can you give us an LPD number
periodically?
SC
LPD number? Yes. Okay.
CAP COM
In fact, if you could give it two
or three rounds in a row, we could predict where it's going
and maybe help us set it up again if we have to.
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay. The center of the earth has
just gone by at an LPD number of 4.
CAP COM
Roger. LPD 4, center of the earth.

And the center of the moon is about
LPD 21.
CAP COM
Okay. LPD 21. Is that center of the
moon you say?
SC
That's affirm.
CAP COM And Fred, you're doing a little better
on water than we had anticipated. Our number were designed
for 3.5 pounds per hour, we're using about 3.0 and expecting
to go a little bit less.

Okay the earth went by that time clear above the
LTV index (garbled). If it was to be extended. The number
would be minus 6.

Okay. Way up there at minus 6.
SC
There's actually no such number. I just extended
the line beyond zero which for a negative rate is what it would
be if there was one.

think I can occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of
sparkling that it really does break up the capability to
pick out a star pattern.

This is Apollo Control at 84 hours 44
minutes. The numbers that Fred Haise just read back down
from the spacecraft refer to the position of the Moon, with
respect to the landing point designator on the LM window.
Haise reported earlier that the passive thermal control
mode possibly was degrading a bit. He said that every time
the spacecraft rotated, the Earth would appear to be a bit
higher in the window and the Moon a bit lower. A short while
after that he said that it may have corrected itself. That
the Earth and the Moon appeared to be in about the right
place. Mission Control asked him to try and give us the
degree readings on the landing point designator for a couple
of revolutions as the Earth and Moon rotated by and we'd
keep a little closer watch on it and see if there was any
significant change.
CAP COM
Jeremy said to say Hello.

Who's that?

Is he still around there?

Hey, tell Charlie that I'll be back down
there personally to thank him for this (garbled).
CAP COM
Sure will. I did.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 84 hours and
48 minutes. The Charlie who was referred to a few minutes
ago in the conversation between Jack Lousma and Fred Haise
was not Astronaut Charles Duke, but rather one Charlie Mars
who looks after the Lunar Modules at Cape Kennedy prior to
launch. At this time the flight plan that we have on one
of our display boards here in Mission Control shows that
Commander Jim Lovell and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert
have a little bit more than 3 hours remaining in their sleep
period. The flight plan is relatively open. Also from
87 hours to 88 hours, which would indicate that there might
be a better flexibility in extending that sleep period.

You'll spend the night in Simoa, get on 141 and be at
Ellington shortly thereafter.

clean that they (garbled) at all (garbled). Okay the Earth's
going by and the LPD 42.
CAP COM Roger. Copy. LPD 42. Is that affirmative?

That's affirmative.
CAP COM Fred, that may be why the COMM's a little
bit degraded, more background noise, because we're getting
out of attitude a little bit there.

activity on all long period samples and this activity was
detected for four hours afterwards with decreasing amplitude.
And the impact was also detected by the high energy (Garbled).

This is Apollo Control at about 85 hours
51 minutes we received a call from the spacecraft. Jim
Lovell reported that he was now taking the watch duties
while Fred Haise attmpted to get some sleep. Jack Swigert
apparently still resting in the Command Module. Lovell reported
that it had gotten a bit chilly in the Command Module. At
the present time Apollo 13 is 197 899 nautical miles from
Earth and travelling at a speed of 3 740 feet per second,
with respect to Earth.
CAP COM Aquarius, in comparing initial estimates
of water usage and electrical power usage, it appears that
we're right on the money. Water usage, we're using a little
less amperes that we had originally expected in the first
analysis, so we're either right on the money or just a little
bit ahead of the game, in that regard.
SC
Well, that sounds encouraging, Jack.
CAP COM There are a few temperatures that we're
watching for you. You have the heaters powered down. We're
looking at them and those include the PIPA's, the ASA, the
QUAD TEMPS, and your propellants except for the DPS propellant.
SC
OK. I've got that.
CAP COM We have, as you probably already know,
several groups working on procedures from here on out. We
have a group working on mid-course corrections to determine
a system, the attitudes, how to do it, alignment techniques
and so forth. We have a group working on the entry to prove
how and when we're going to activate the CSM. We have a group
working on the CSM system status, and in a few hours. Later
on tomorrow, when we see it, we're going to build us a face

Right now the COMM is kind of degrading and I can't hear
what you're about to say very well, but I just want to keep
you advised as to how things are going here. And remember
you've got duty of the antennas.

Aquarius, are you reading, Houston?

(Garbled)
CAP COM Okay, Jim. I can hear you talking but I
can't tell what you're saying because you're way down

my report on the various types of people and what they're
doing around here?

Roger. Sounds like you had things well
organized (garbled)
CAP COM Okay, Jim. I didn't catch that so - On
account of the background noise maybe we can pass it on
when it gets more favorable.

I'm thinking of (garbled) Aquarius (garbled)
CAP COM
Okay. I heard you say something about
using the hycon camera in Aquarius.
SC
I'm thinking of (garbled) attitude. We're
40 degrees behind Aquarius (garbled).
CAP COM Oh, I understand you're thinking about
stowage. What'll we leave behind in Aquarius when we fall
back into Odyssey. Is that right?

That's affirmative.

And we're presently tracking you at 22 500 miles from the
Moon moving out at 4400 feet a second.
SC

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 86 hours 9 minutes.
Communications continue to be rather noisy due in part to
the fact that the lunar module has drifted somewhat out of
it's passive thermal control attitude and we don't have the
best angle on the antennas for reception from the lunar
module. During that last series of conversations with
Jim Lovell and CAP COM Jack Lousma, advised him of the status
of all consumables on the spacecraft. He reported that the
consumables were either ahead of the predicted values or
at least right on them. Jim Lovell replied, "That is
encouraging". Lovell also asks that here on the ground
we look at the stowage in the command module and lunar
module, particularly with an eye to what things can be
left behind in the lunar module when the crew moves back
into the command module for Earth entry.
CAP COM - Earlier in the evening we thought there
was a misunderstanding about the amount of potable water

number 1 in the command module, and he also reported a
piece of loose metal about 4 inches square, silver, floating
by, and one thing we were trying to establish is whether or
not this is a new venting or whether this is part of the residual
venting of our original problem. Do you have any more words
or comments. And one thing he was doing was taking some
photographs, the authorized photographs, targets of opportunity,
using the lunar surface camera number one, and use the setting
of 1/250 of a second and now knowing precisely what F stop he
used, we suggested taking 3 of each using settings of F4, F5.6,

me now?
CAP COM Well, there is a lot of background noise
and sometimes it is worse than others and right now I hear
you better than I have in the past.
SC
Okay, Jack, I'm kind of curious about the
amount of perturbations our PTC attitude is making. I notice
that we are getting off attitude I'm just kind of curious
how far we can let this go.
CAP COM We were checking the attitudes with Fred
earlier and it looks like what we were doing was oscillating
about some point but coming back - are you detecting some
kind of divergence now?
SC
Not too much. I notice that it's different
than when I went to sleep. They are more at an angle now
with the terminator of the earth SO when (garbled) you are
just about parallel with the terminator and now we are canted
off somewhat. I haven't seen any trends, though, of going
back and forth.
CAP COM And Jim, our current plan is to not
correct the PTC. We're going to take whatever we get and
live with it. And we can kind of keep track what's going
on a little better if when you swing past the earth and
swing past the center of the moon if you could read off the
LPD angles for the center of the earth and the center of
the moon. Over.

We are venting something back there I can see
particles moving past the command module what it is I don't
know.
CAP COM
Okay, Can you identify the quadrant?
SC
Well, I'm looking through the right rear
window now of AOG, and when I was back in the Command Module
I could see it out of the g of one window. The particles are
rather small, but they are coming on with some force. That's
probably what is disturbing our PTC attitude.
CAP COM Yes, that sounds quite probable, Jim.
That's about the same report we got from Fred, but we haven't
beeen able to identify what they might be and probably won't
be able to until we crank up the CSM. If there's any change
in that status, why, we just want to keep advised of it.
SC
Roger. Understand.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 86 hours 35
minutes. That conversation was a bit difficult to copy
entirely. Lovell reported that he had noticed some small
particles coming out of the Command Module apparently coming
out of the Command Module. A service module, to be more
specific. He said he did not know what the particles were,
but that they were small and coming out with some force, and
he suggested that this venting was probably disturbing the
PTC attitude of the spacecraft.
CAP COM Looks like you're a little bit outside
of the corridor. We're looking at a 7 foot per second mid-
course at 104 hours. We are going to come up with a entry
interface minus 8 PAD to use in event of a loss of comm
situation.
SC
Roger. Understand, and I hope you have
that procedure for an attitude.
CAP COM We are ginning up a procedure for
attitude for you, Jim. For the no Comm case, it may be a
little different than what the guys working on the procedures
come up with for the burn at 104 hours.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM What I'm saying, Jim, is the guys who
are working on this attitude situation for the burns haven't
made their final conclusions yet, but in the interim period
we want to come up with something you can use, in the event
that you lose ground.
SC
I concur.

Okay, we read 24, Jim.

That's affirm.
PAO
Jim Lovell continuing to report the
relative positions of the earth and the moon as they rotate
by his LM window. He is comparing the position with a grid
marked on the lunar module window, the landing point desig-
nator, which is a calibrated grid, and by noting the shift
in the position of both the earth and the moon as the space-
craft rotates we're able to get at least a rough idea of
how much the spacecraft attitude is deviating from the original
passive thermal control attitude. Now the combined CSM/LM
stack is rotating at a rate of about one revolution every
11 minutes at this time. Repeating again, both Lovell and
Fred Haise have reported seeing particles coming from the
area of the service module, apparently venting. Fred Haise
was asked at the time he reported it if he felt it was con-
tinued venting from the original event which lost the power
and oxygen from the service module or a new event, and he
did not know. A short while ago Jim Lovell reported seeing
a similar phenomena. He described it as small particles
coming out of the spacecraft from what appeared to be the
service module. He said that they were coming out with
some force and mentioned that this was probably disturbing
the passive thermal control attitude. We're watching this
with some interest in Mission Control, but with no concern
at this point. The primary concern, as I mentioned, is
with what effect it would have on the passive thermal control
attitude. However, this is not a significant problem. The
effect on the passive thermal control attitude is relatively
small. The flight dynamics officer has also reported that
there is relatively little effect on the position of the
vehicle as reflected in the ground tracking of the spacecraft,
which would lead us to believe that the venting is relatively
small.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 4:18A GET 87:04:00 354/1
CAP COM Okay, Jim. Just as kind of a lead in
to this procedure that we're going to use for the midcourse
burn, I'd like to say that we're going to use AGS and it's
going to be a manual burn. The attitude will be controlled
manually and start-stop on the engine will be controlled
manually. So we have a pretty good vector on you now and
it turn out you're coming in a little bit too shallow. So
what that means is that we're going to make our burn to
come a little more steeply and we're going to be coming in
around the dark side of the earth. Therefore, to come in
more steep, our thrust should be in the direction with the
sun. Does that all make sense to you?
SC
(garbled) we're going to use AGS
for a burn monitor. The burns are going to be manual and
they're going to be started manually and stopped manually.
CAP COM Okay. And your reentry is around
the dark side of the earth and sense we're coming in shallow
we're going to have to burn toward the sun to make it
steeper. Do you follow that?
SC
That's affirm. Especially these
burns perpendiculr to our flight path and to the sun giving
a deeper entry angle.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. I heard you say perpendi-
cular to the flight path, which is affirmative and I didn't
get the rest of your statement.
SC
I understand the technique, Jack.
We're going to give it time to steepen our entry angle and
it will be perpendicular to our flight path for a corridor
control.
CAP COM Okay. That's affirmative. So,
in general terms, what we're going to have to do is to power
up the AGS and bring up the AG rate ball and then to set
up your attitude, put the COAS in the front window and
guidance control will be in AGS, of course, to manually
orient the spacecraft, to place the center of the earth
directly out the Z-axis. Then rotate about the Z-axis to
place the point of the crescent on the Y-axis of the COAS.
And this will have your plus X-axis in the direction of
the sun as we discussed before. So the crescent will be
up with the point down. Copy that?
SC
Okay, Jack. We'll have to go over
that again. The COAS will be out front window, rotate the
earth to the center of the COAS and, let's see the (garbled)
of the earth is parallel to the LPD which is about parallel
to our X-axis. And we'll have to rotate about 90 degrees
to get our X-axis pointing toward the sun.
CAP COM Okay, Jim, so we want to get the
Y-axis of the spacecraft parallel to the terminator by
putting the points of the crescent on the Y-axis.

--- PAGE 492 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 4:18A GET 87:04:00 354/2
SC
Roger. Write it down. Seriously,
Jack, I got the phase that I put you (garbled) the earth,
I'm going to have to roll in LM time, roll the spacecraft
90 degrees to get the (garbled) of the earth ball on the
Y-axis.
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. You're
going to have to roll 90 degrees to point your plus X-axis
at the sun and put the crescent the point of the crescent
on the Y-axis. The points of the crescent on the Y-axis
with the COAS pointed at the center of the earth will take
care of your yaw and your pitch.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. After you get that orienta-
tion to come in a little more steeply, we perform AGS body
axis aline which is 400 plus 5 on the vida. If the AGS
ball is up at this time, the AGS ball will go to 000. We
can talk more about control modes later, but we recommend
doing this, of course, in AGS attitude hold. Attitude hold.
Put your yaw to mode control and leave pitch and roll in pulse.
Therefore, controlling your attitude with the PTCA. We don't
want to use the gimbal so have engine gimbal off. We'll
make the burns at 10 percent thrust. We'll use a manaual
start and stop. For ullage, we'll use the plus X transla-
tional button and ullage will be for 10 seconds. Over.

Okay. Understand what you're saying,
but you'll have to repeat it here.

PITCH to pulse and YAW to mode control. So the AGS will

stop manual, for ullage use the plus X translational button
10 seconds ullage. Over.

AGS, full control ATT hold, attitude switches will be ROLL pull

CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. After you get
oriented the attitude you want to burn in do an AGS and
lines which is 400 plus 5. When you hit air this will bring

gimbal engine off. O-F-F. Over.

CAPCOM And, Jim, on the - setting up the
AGS, right after we do the 400 plus 5, you should do a 400
plus all balls. And one other point we want to clarify is
that we know that you're sure that this burn will be made
with the plus X axis pointing at the sun to make the entry
angle steeper. You got it?
SC
That's right, Jack. But right now
we're at - we're stopped up here in the commander's window
the COAS down and I'm going to maneuver the spacecraft
until I have the right portion of the earth at the top
of the window. Now if the course will be along the plus
Y of the spacecraft and the top of the window of the ren-
dezvous window I should be looking into the sun. That
means I'll be burning it towards the sun and figure the
angles (garbled).
CAP COM That's right, Jim. You got the atti-
tude right and did you copy about doing a 400 plus all balls
after - after you do the 400 plus 5. That is a 400 plus 5
and 400 plus all zeros back to back.
SC
Roger. I have copied that.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 87 hours
29 minutes. The conversaiton which we just had with Jim
Lovell related to a - what is called a pad data for entry
interface minus 8 hours. This is a more or less routine
bit of information which is passed to the spacecraft at
various portions of the mission the purpose of which is
to give them the information they would need to perform
a critical maneuver were they out of communications with
Mission Control for any reason. In this particular case,
this would be the burn that would put them in the proper
position for reentry, if at some point, prior to entry
they had lost communications with Mission Control. Normally,
of course, the final midcourse corrections will be made
with the information passed from the ground including the
spacecraft attitudes. Without communications to the space-
craft, it would be necessary for them to determine their
own attitude.
SC
This is Aquarius. I'm not too sure
how long or with what force the venting is going to do our
trajectory Although, you might keep it turned on that. Indeed
it's been going on for some time.

Lovell's question there pertained to
the -
SC
- pretty small
PAO
Lovell's question pertained to the
venting, which he reported a short while ago. He was asking
if the vent was having effect on the trajectory and suggest-
ing that we monitor it to determine how significant effect
the venting from the service module might have on the space-
craft trajectory. As we mentioned before, we've been tracking
and Flight Dynamics Officer reported that he could detect
no change in the trajectory which could be attributed to
a venting to that reason we would suspect that the effect
of the particles coming out of the service module is minimal
and from that we would also conclude that the vent is quite
small.

All right. Thanks.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 87 hours, 36
minutes. The series of numbers passed up to the spacecraft
several minutes ago, as we were saying, related to the pad
information which the crew would use in the event they were
out of communications with Mission Control because of some
unforeseen failure, and were not able to receive from the ground
the information needed to do a final midcourse correction
prior to entry. In this case, Lovell would be required to get
the spacecraft in the proper attitude and perform final midcourse
correction with numbers supplied previously, and those numbers
were just passed up to him. The procedure for putting the
spacecraft in the proper attitude would be to use the sun
and the earth as reference points, and then once the spacecraft
was in the proper attitude he would perform the maneuver as
indicated on the entry interface minus 8-hour pad, which we
just read up to him. This of course, would be a back-up
procedure. The normal procedure would be to use the onboard
guidance equipment and numbers supplied prior to the burn
from the ground, and only in the event of some unforeseen
communications failure would this backup procedure be used.
At the present time Apollo 13 is 194 269 nautical miles from
the earth and traveling at a velocity of 3771 feet per second.
Coming up at 90 hours, 24 minutes, and 40 seconds, the spacecraft
will cross into what is known as the earth's sphere of influence.
At this point in Mission Control we'll begin calculating the
spacecraft altitudes and velocities for trajectory purposes
with respect to the earth rather than with respect to the
moon, and we'll also at that point begin to see the velocity
climb as a result of the ever increasing of Earth gravity.
On the spacecraft, up until that point, the trajectory displays
would indicate the spacecraft slowing down under the dominant
affect of the lunar gravity. The height from the earth at the
point of sphere crossing would be 188 067 nautical miles, and
the distance from the moon at that time would be 33 821 nautical
miles. One other bit of information from the Flight Dynamics
Officer is that the mid point in terms of distance will occur
at 119 hours, 44 minutes, 33 seconds; at that point the space-
craft will be 110 730 nautical miles from Earth, and from the
Moon. At 87 hours, 39 minutes, this is Mission Control Houston.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 4:58A GET 87:44:00 358/1
CAP COM Jim, in that control mode, that sounds like
the best way to go. The only thing you'll have to do is to
get attitude hold in the AGS, SO before you start to maneuver
you' 11 have to bring the AGS up and get a 400 plus all zeros
in there and then AGS will respond in yaw when you go to mode
control. That is, AGS will control your yaw in mode control
and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in pulse with
a PTCA. After you get in attitude, then, you'll have to re-do
an AGS body axis align which is 400 plus 5, then go back to
400 plus all zeros again.
SC
Right, Jack. That was my next question. I
don't want to align the AGS ball 000 until I am in position,
so we use that as a primary attitude rate monitor device.
CAP COM And Jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any
time you want to; that just tells the AGS that you want it
to control your attitude should you go to attitude hold in mode
control.
SC
I understand, but after we get to the attitude
we'll do a 400 plus five to get the AGS align ball and then
we'll do a 400 plus zero.
CAP COM Affirmative.
CAP COM Another thing, Jim, is while you're maneuvering
to that attitude using AGS to control your yaw, should you find
out in route to that attitude that you didn't quite have the
yaw where you wanted it to be, you can use your ACA and tweek
up the yaw and your AGS needles go right back to zero because
you zero the attitude errors.
SC
Roger, sounds good.
CAP COM Jim, you'll be splashing down about 560 miles
southeast of Samoa at about 0 800 local time. The weather
forecast for the area is good. 1500 scattered, high broken,
10 miles visibility. The seas will be five foot waves,
15 knots, and you'll be going to Samoa by boat and/or aircraft.

Okay Jack. It appears that we're
feeling a funny vibration and here the PTC attitude is pitch.
I'm going to do a LPD check now, but the last time the moon
went around it was above - away above the LPD angle
and see the Earth coming around now which is going to be pretty
low. The (garble) is forward, but each time we're getting a
little farther away from the centerline. You might think of
some procedure to re-establish the PTC, if necessary.
CAP COM
Okay.
CAP COM Jim, the only way we know of getting
the good or better PTC than you've got right now is to
crank up the P and N and we don't want to do that. So our
plan is to just take whatever we get out of this, and either
one may turn out by the time you get to burn attitude. You
will be right here on abse.

What's our course of action to set
up PTC after this midcourse at 107?
CAP COM We thought you'd ask that. The only
thing we can try to do Jim, is to set the thing up manually
and see what happens there must be a better answer to that.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM One course of action is to omit the
midcourse and take this other midcourse, say, about 8 hours
before entry. We haven't decided yet.
CAP COM Right now we're talking about a
7 foot per second midcourse at 104 hours. The extrapolate
that down to about 8 hours before entry. We gave you a pad for
that just about (garble) per second, so if it doesn't change too
much we can get all kinds of DPS.

AQUARIUS Can you think of any normal phenomena
that might occur like maybe - a hydrogen tank that over-
pressurized relieving (garble)
CAP COM Yeah, we thought of that Jim.
CAP COM That is one possibility that we thought
of Jim because we heated up that tank and we never used any
hydrogen and therefore it could be venting in the overboard
release.
AQUARIUS Right the only other thing I can think
of when I look at it through the AOG is it disappeared and its
coimg to one spot; that's the only difference although I can't
see where it is coming from because its beyond the curvature
of the command module. It seems like it might be coming from
more than just one spot.
CAP COM Okay, thank you. We hope that when we
crank up the command module tomorrow it will - or later on
today that we will be able to identify it, a little closer,
what kind of problem, but the guidance guys say that they
haven't been able to see the results of any venting in your
data and it would take a very, very small amount to disturb
their data.

P AO
This is Apollo Control at 89 hours. A
short while ago, just moments ago, you heard a bit of music
on the air to ground line coming in over the noise. Jack
Swigert, the Capsule Communicator, or rather, Jack Lousma, the
Capsule Communicator checked with Jim Lovell and Jim confirmed
that the music was coming down from the spacecraft. At the
present time the status aboard the spacecraft is - as best we
can tell, is that Lovell is the only one of the 3 crewmen who
is up and about. Jack Swigert has been resting since about
82 hours elapsed time, and Fred Haise began his rest period at
86 hours ground elapsed time. Lovell rested from about 82 hours
until about 86 hours, now when he changed positions with Fred
Haise taking over the watch. At the present time Apollo 13 is
191 187 nautical miles from Earth, and traveling at a speed
with respect to Earth of 3804 feet per second. We expect to
continue having quite a bit of noise on the communication line
communication circuit with the spacecraft - partially due to
the fact that the spacecraft, in its passive thermal control
attitude, is deviating somewhat from this attitude and we do
not have the optimum positions on our antennas on the spacecraft
on the antennas for strongest reception. This situation corrects

--- PAGE 507 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/15/70 CST 6:08A GET 88:50 365/2
PAO
itself somewhat as the spacecraft continues
to rotate at the rate of 1 revolution every 11 minutes and
periodically we get a combination of antenna positions on
the spacecraft with respect to the antennas on ground that
improves our communications situation. We do not intend to
attempt to modify the spacecraft attitude with the primary
guidance system powered down at this time, the feeling is
that the attitude we would get by trying to reestablish the
passive thermal control mode manually would probably not be as
good as the one that weve got right now. So the plan is to live
with the communications problem and to expect that we will
have periods during which it will not be possible to get
usable communications because of the background noise. At
Mission Control at this time, we are beginning the shift
change, the handover, a number of flight controllers have come
in from the - for the succeeding shift; flight director Glynn
Lunney and his black team of flight controllers will be replacing
flight direction Milton Windler and the maroon team. And that
shift handover is scheduled to occur at about 7 AM Central
Standard Time, or about 45 minutes from -

is at 96 hours, which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before
that, say at 95 hours all three of you would eat and then Jack
would hit the sack and Fred would have the duty to until one or
two hours. We'd be glad to take care of this (garble)

Okay, that's good. Let me wait til they get
up at least Jack is up he should get up before Fred. We'll
try to get back on the schedule. I hate to wake everybody

CAP COM Okay. Now then, we want you to take the
tape and cut out 2 pieces about 3 feet long, or a good arms
length, and what we want you to do with them is to make two
belts around the sides of the canister, one belt near the
top and one belt near the bottom, with the sticky side out;
wrap it around, sticky side out, as tight as possible. It'll
probably take both of you to get it nice and snug. Over.
ODESSEY (garble) Okay, now we've got to make
the belt real taut.

Okay, Joe.
CAPCOM
Okay, Jack (garble)
SC
(garble)
CAPCOM
Jack - -
SC
(garble) the one around the bottom all done.
CAP COM
Okay, fine. The next step now is to
anchor that tape and the way we want you to do that is to
cut about a 2-foot line from the roll and then tear it
lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long
and about a half an inch wide. And you'll wrap those around
the canister at right angles, more or less, to the tape that
you've got so that it goes across the top and across the
bottom and when it goes across the top and the bottom, put
it so that it's outboard of the center hole and try to get
it over one of the ridges between the screens S O that it
won't block the flow. Is that clear? Over.
SC
Yeah, Joe. Very good.
CAP COM
Okay, press on.
SC
Okay, I've got a (garble) and we tear
it lengthwise (garble) all the way around at right angles
and anchor it (garble)
SC
Joe, should we fire (garble) PTS down,
right?
SC
(garble)
CAPCOM
I didn't quite copy that, Jack. Say
again.
SC
Okay, that will be the sticky end down on
the container right?
CAP COM
That's correct. I forgot to say that.
That's right.
SC
(garble)
SC
Okay, Joe, Qauarius we've got that
set.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack, the next step is to get
the EVA Q-card and use it to form an arch over the top of the
canister, just tuck one short end under one ridge on the top
the other one against the ridge on the other side so that it
forms a rounded up arch over the top of the canister. You
see, Jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag over this
whole assembly and the Q-card will serve to keep the bag from
being sucked down against the screen. Over.
SC
Okay, I got that, Joe.
CAP COM Okay, and when you've done that, to
hold the arch in place, just run a strip of tape across the
side of the - that is across the top of the arch and anchor
it down to the sticky strips along each side.
SC
Okay, I got that set. Okay, let
me just repeat it here. EVA Q-card form an arch over the top

bringing it under the side here, when

of that anchor to the other side.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/15/70 CST 7:54A GET 91:28 376/1
AQUARIUS Okay, Joe, we've done that belt, and its
all fixed in securely.
CAP COM Okay, Jack, the next step is to stop up
the bypass hole which is the hole in the center of the bottom
of the canister; we want to stop that up because we don't want
to bypass the flow, and I forgot to tell you to get something
to stick in that hole. We recommend that you either use a
wetwipe or cut off a piece of sock and stuff it in there or
you could probably even crumble up some tape and use that; over.
AQUARIUS Okay, we'll start plugging up the bypass hole.
CAP COM Okay.
AQUARIUS Plug that hole. How about a piece of your
towel?
CAP COM Sounds good.
AQUARIUS Okay, Houston, Aquarius; we have the bypass
all plugged up.
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius. The next step is take the
inner LCG bag that you cut open, and slip it over the top of
the canister, when you do that, orient it so that the ears of
the bag, the corners that stick out on the closed are
oriented along the open ends of the arch, cause we're going
to snip one of those corners to stick the hose in. Pull it
down until it fits snugly over the arch. Over.
AQUARIUS Okay, Joe; slip the bag over the canister
so that the arch is at the bottom of the bag and the ears are
along - I guess it would be at the side of the arch.
CAP COM Depends on what you mean by sides - the
open end of the arch.
AQUARIUS Right - the open ends of the arch. Okay.
AQUARIUS Okay, Joe, we've got that done.
CAP COM Okay, now press the bag against the sticky
belts that we put on the sides of the canister; if there is
any excess material, just kinda pleat it, so that it makes a
fairly tight seal, and then take another 3 foot strip of sticky
tape and wrap it around the outside of the bag opposite the
bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice tight seal.
AQUARIUS Okay. You want 2 strips down here, to
make a tight seal. Okay.
END OF TAPE

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 8:03A GET 90:50:20 377/1
SC
Okay, Joe we've got the canister inside the
bag, two strips are around the side of the bag, real tight,
and both sealed.
CAP COM Okay, real fine. Now there's probably a
couple of inches of excess bag sticking out around the bottom
of the canister; to prevent this from sucking in against the
bottom screen we'd like you to trim it off with the scissors
and when you've done that we'd like you to cut 2 more strips
of tape about twelve inches long or so, cut the - tear them
lengthwise to get four pieces 12 inches long and 1/2-inch
wide and then use those four strips to secure the bag by
passing the strips from the sides of the canister outside the
bag around the bottom of the canister and back up the other
side and when you do this, just as you did on the top, make
them go outward of the hole and in between the screens. Over.
SC
Okay. You want me to trim the excess material
that's sticking out, trim it at the edge of that canister or
do you want any excess left over?
CAP COM No, you don't need to have any excess. Just
trim it approximately level.
SC
Okay, let's do that first.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, now, Joe, you want to cut 4 strips,
12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter tape that along
the outside of the bag across the ribs.
CAP COM That's correct, Jim. That's just for addi-
tional security on the bag. When you get those done you'll
have you'll have 2 strips going one way and the other 2
will be perpendicular to them.
SC
Okay, Houston, Aquarius we've got four strips
in place.
CAP COM Okay, we're in business now with the bag and
the next step to perform is to get ready to put the red suit
hose, either the commander's or the LMP's because we're going
to want you to have both of these made up eventually, into
the top of the bag and to do that you, first of all, have to
assure that the - that the red hose is separated from the
blue hose. I don't know whether this has been done already
but if it hasn't what you have to do is cut the outer Beta
cloth sheath down the full length of the of the hoses and
then also cut the rubber ties that secure the two hoses
together and the hoses should come apart and the COMM cable
should come on. Over.
SC
Okay. Take the I'm going to separate the
red hose from the blue hose by cutting your Beta cloth sheath.
Okay, that should work.
CAP COM
Okay.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 8:15A GET 91:01:30 378/1
SC
Okay, Houston, Aquarius. I have the
LOP's separated from the others.
CAP COM Okay, real fine. Now the next step is
to cut a diagonal hole is one ear of the plastic bag near
the arch. You can pick either one and cut about a 1-1/2 or
2 inch diagonal hole, big enough to slip the red hose through
and you've done that you' 11 just slip the red hose through
so that it goes about to the center of the canister. It's
not critical except that the opening should be down and then
tape the bag to the hose where it goes in so that it's nice
and snug. Over.
SC
Okay, copy that. We want a 1-1/2 inch
hole right here at this ear, put the hose in here head down
and toward the canister and tape the seal right here.
SC
Let's try it if we have to, we can always
make it bigger if we have to (garble)
SC
Say, Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, go ahead.
SC
Okay, our do-it-yourself (garbled) lithum
hydroxide unit is complete. Joe, the only thing different is
that our arch on this piece of cardboard is -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 522 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 8:24A GET 91:22:05 379/1
SC
The only thing different is that our arch
on this piece of cardboard is not big enough to position
the red hose with the inlet down, and the inlet - the inlet
to the red hose is lying on its side, but I think it'll still
work
CAPCOM Okay, Jack, I concur. I think it'll work
too. There's one step that I omitted, which you can do now quite
conveniently, and it's this. Where you stuff the towel in the
bipass hole on the bottom, we recommend that you cut a few
short pieces of tape and just tape that over so it doesn't fall
out. Over.
SC
Okay. Will do. (garble)
SC
Okay, Joe. That's finished.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps
are simply suit loop configuration steps to get this thing in-
to full operation, and our ECS people want to hold off on that
until the canister you'r working on gets to 7.6 millimeters
mercury, which will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour
yet. We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like for you to do
in the interim is to set up the second command module canister
the same way you just did the first one using the commanders
hose, and get that all set and probably about that time it'll
be time to switch over. For your information when you'v got
that done and you've had your breakfast and SO on, the next
thing I've got for you is a switch configuration list for the
command module, which will represent the power down, square 1
starting configuration for all our preentry checks. Over.
SC
Okay. We'll start setting up the Commanders
(garble)
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jack. What we have
done is marked up the liftoff configuration check list, and
we'll run through it whenever you get around to it.
SC
(inaudible)
SC
(garble)
SC
Okay, Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
SC
Okay, Joe. Should this canister be operation
now because it's already mounted on the hose.
CAP COM Well, yes. We haven't completely
configured the suit loop to get full flow through there and
it's okay the way it is, what I recommend you do with the
commanders hose is get the bag all ready, but not slip the
hose in until we call you on that. Okay.
SC
Okay, will do.

Kerwin has passed up to the crew some items of shade tree
engineering on how to build the lithium hydroxide canister
container which uses the suit system - suit circuit return
hoses in the lunar module, and these two canisters will scrub
the atmosphere, removing carbon dioxide. This is primarily a
backup to look forward to the time when the time has run out
on the canisters in the lunar module. Present position
now as shown by the space digital display which at this moment
are on a Moon reference frame, showing 36 688 nautical miles
from the moon, this computes out in Earth distance to about
184 830 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity rela-
tive to the Moon 4284 feet per second. Current usage electrical
current still hovering around 12 to 14 amps. At this time,
Haise apparently is still sleeping. All consumable usage is
at either on or below the predicted levels and at 91 hours,

CAP COM Okay, we don't have anything for you,
our only concern is that you'll wake up somebody; is there anybody
sleeping right now?
AQUARIUS No - we're all sitting here eating; I'm
just gonna get a bite to eat, then I'll write down that switch
configuration, or I'll copyt he procedure now if you want.
CAP COM Yeah, okay. Understand they are all up.
Did you say you wanted to copy the other procedure now? Over.
AQUARIUS I can if you want. Its your choice.
CAP COM I'd rather you went ahead with the switch
configuration Jack.
AQUARIUS Okay, let's do that, then I'll be back with
you.
CAP COM Okay, see you later. And tell Jim that
Deke wants to go to bed.
AQUARIUS Okay, I'll tell him that right now.

there, flight has got one other item for you.
AQUARIUS Deke wants you to go to bed.
SC
(talking within the spacecraft)
SC
You know what I thought I think what we saw
venting was the result of our Delta V's stirring up. Popping
the relief valve.
SC
Yeah.
SC
I don't see anything venting now.
AQUARIUS
Okay, Houston, we are standing by.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, Over.
AQUARIUS
Okay Joe.
CAP COM Okay, Jack, you can go ahead and set up that
switch configuration - what we are discussing is having you
activate your main bus tie motor switches later on simply to verify
that they will be okay, because the batteries are probably getting
a little bit cool. But we'll be back to you with a procedure and
discussion about that after you get the switch configuration set
up; over.
AQUARIUS Okay, I'm going to get the switch configuration
done now before Jim goes to bed so I don't disturb him.
CAP COM
Okay, real fine.
AQUARIUS Jim thinks he sounds like Frank Borman on
Apollo 8.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/15/70 CST 9:52A GET 92:40 388/2
AQUARIUS Okay, before I hit the sack Joe, I just
want to make sure you're still plotting on MCC at 107 and whats the
latest find?
CAP COM Okay, Jim, we are still gathering our
thoughts on the MCC, but some of the considerations go like
this; FIDO tells us that we can do that correction probably
as late as 118 hours, with no significant Delta V penalty,
and with plenty of tracking thereafter to make sure that
we've gotten the right thing, and to set you up for a late
MCC if we need it, which we probably wouldn't. We are happy
with the PTC mode that you are in now, and although we are
working up a ags PTC mode to use after the midcourse correction,
we kinda like you to stay in this PTC for awhile because it
is doing good. We are looking at the weather in the landing
area - we don't think we'll have a problem, but we are checking
it real close, and if there is any changing that we want
to do, we want to get it into this midcourse correction. For
reasons like that, we are considering possibly delaying the
midcourse correction from 104 hours to sometime between there
and 118; we'd like to know what you think about it; over.
LOVELL We have no druthers. As long as we
do the midcourse, and there is plenty of tracking thereafter
to correct the midcourse; that's my only concern.
CAP COM Okay, Jim, roger that. And based on
FIDO's input that he'd like to do it not later than 24 hours
before EI, we will be doing it prior to 118 hours.
LOVELL
Okay.
AQUARIUS Hello Houston, Aquarius, Go ahead.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, go.
AQUARIUS Question; Joe. Jim has been talking
to me about how we are going to do this midcourse, and
awhile back when we went through this power up, we
had pulled the stab control ASA breaker; I was wondering
if the lost the heaters in the ASA; I was wondering how it
looked; what kind of shape it's gonna be in.
CAP COM
Okay, stand by there Fred.

Okay, very good.
SC
Ed, I don't know if Jack gone to you but
Jack and I just finished logging about 6 hours sleep, each.
CAP COM Roger, Fred. Copy that. Is it a little chilly
up there?
SC
Yeah. We made the mistake of putting up the
window shades which we won't do again and we just powered our
mode, we're not generating much internally and it really did
get chilly.

Fred, just wanted to let you know in advance
that we're coming up on the red line C02 value for the sec-
ondary canister and we expect to get there something like
a half hour at which time we'll be asking you to switch over
to the Command Module canisters. I have the rest of that
procedure ready and I just wanted to warn you a little bit
in advance.
SC
Okay. And I've got a question for you, Joe.

Okay. The I need to find out if the
condensing container that we were going to use to strain some
water in on the lunar surface now is this container also
completely air tight? Ok ay to use it to (GARBLE)

AQUARIUS Okay, Joe, we need some place to put the
urine.
CAP COM Okay, it sounds to me as if the suggested
receptacle is perfectly satisfactory; do you think you can
use it in its present configuration?
AQUARIUS Oh yeah, we got all the innerconnects mocked
up we need, but I wasn't sure if that gadget was devised soley
with the 1-6th g environment in mind, and whether it might leak,
now in zero g.

SC
Okay, Joe. One thing I noticed. There
are a couple of circuits here now, the pulse star is taking a
number of them, is marginally decreased, and what I thought
rather bad and apparently that added venting we had out of the

go. It appears to have stopped now.

CAP COM Okay. Copy. Ready to go ahead and
get you on the command module canisters. As the first step,
I'd like to know whether you've inserted the commander's red
hose to the second canister bag. Over.
SC
Okay, yeah, sure enough commander's
red hose is inserted into the canister bag.
CAPCOM Okay, Fred. The next thing I'd like
you to do is to take some more grey tape and tape over half
the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles of commander's
in the LMP. The reason we're doing this is we're going to be
running this loop through the secondary LiOH canister hole with
the canister removed and we don't have the flow restriction we
need to keep the separator from over speeding. Over.
SC
Okay. Yes, that's right. So we want
to tape over half of both the blue and the red commander hoses.
Is that right?
CAP COM Negative, Fred. That's half of the
commander's blue hose and half of the LMP's blue hose outlet
hoses.
SC
Oh, okay. I'll tape over half of each
of the outlets. Stand by.

CAPCOM Okay, Fred (garble) the LMP red hose is
(garble) In that case, we would like you to follow the pro-
cedure for inserting the other red hose in the other cannister
bas (garbel) as follows: cut a diaganal hole in one
corner of the bag stick the hose in about 6 inches and
try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can, or else

CAPCOM Okay. Let's complete the next step is to
switch to the primary C02 canister and remove the secondary
canister and stow it. Over.
SC
Okay. I'm going to have to get on COMM here,
I'll let Jack get the head set.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Hey, Joe, (GARBLE) set down.
SC
Start secondary.
SC
Both cartridges are out.
SC
Okay, Joe, Fred has the secondary cartridge
out. We're back on primary now.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. The next step is to place the
Command Module canisters with the hoses attached in a suitable
location to permit the bottom of the canister to be exposed
to free air flow and tape them in place. Ideally, well, it
doesn't matter. Just - just pick out your own spot.
SC
Okay, I'm going to tell you where they are.
They're both situated (GARBLE) canister exposed to free air
and one of these are right by (GARBLE)
CAP COM Jack, Houston. The COMM got real noisy there
and I didn't copy that.
SC
Okay, Joe, how do you read now?
CAP COM
Okay, that's real good Jack, go ahead.
SC
Okay, the canisters are situated as you would
like with the bottom of the canister exposed to free air.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
The position of the LP's canister the LP's
canister is staying on the ECS panel now and the CDR's canis-
ter is positioned up in the tunnel.
CAP COM Okay, real fine, Jack. The next step is to
physically separate both blue hoses a good distance away from
the canister SO that we don't short circuit the flow and
tape them in place and the ideal location for them would be
up in the tunnel so as to get some flow into the Command
Module. Over.

SC
Both hoses in the - up in to the Command Module.
CAP COM Well, you can use your judgment on that Jack
We'd like at least one and the recommendation that I got was
to put them both up in the tunnel.
SC
Okay, we have the LP's blue hose up by the
LP's window and the, of course, the red hose is separated
by itself about 4 feet. The other hose, the has the extension
on it. The CDR's blue hose, of course, has the extension on it
and it's blowing way up in the Command Module and the red hose is
about oh, it's right at the docking ring where the blue latches
are so there's about 4 or 5 feet difference from there to. Is this
satisfactory?
CAP COM Okay, Jack, that sounds satisfactory. The
next steps are are suit loop configuration steps and the
first one is to place the suit diverter valve to the full
Egress position.
SC
Okay suit diverter valves to full Egress.
CAP COM
That's affirmative.
SC
That done.
CAP COM
Okay, the next step is cabin gas return
to egress. Over.

CAP COM
Yes, we did turn the egress. Over.
SC
No I didn't get that Joe. Cabin gas returned
to egress.
CAPCOM
That's correct.
SC
Okay that's done.
CAP COM
Okay, next, suit circuit relief to CLOSE.
Over.
SC
Suit circuit relief to CLOSE.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
Okay, I got that done.
CAP COM
Okay, and the last step is select secondary
C02 canister, let it flow through the empty hole and let's see how
we do.
SC
Select secondary C02 canister.
CAP COM
Roger, Jack. That completes that procedure
and the next thing I've got for you is a procedure for going
back into the Command Module and powering up the main BUSES
temporarily using the B US tie switches. We want to do this
for two reasons: first of all, we want it absolutely verified
that there are no loads on the main BUSES, that we've got
everything off and that the BUSES look good, and the second
thing we want to do is to power the BUS, the main BUSES with
the B US tie motor switches and then depower them by pulling
the circuit breakers, leaving the main BUS tie switches in the

SC
Okay, Joe. How you read?
CAP COM Better now, Jack. Satisfactory. Did
you copy my rational for the main bus power up.
SC
Yes, I did. Do you want a power up both
buss's with buss type motor switches first of all to see that
there are no loads on the buss's and second depower the Buss's
by pulling the circuit breaker to insure that the motor switches
don't - so the Buss's stay on so they're there when we need them.
CAP COM That's correct, Jack. Are you ready
to copy the procedure?
SC
Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. As the first step, I have one
change to the basic configuration that we gave you. It's
2 more circuit breakers that we want open. On panel 225.
Are you ready to write that down? Over.
SC
Yes. I'm all ready Joe.
SC
Joe, I'm all ready. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. On panel 225, we want the
rendezvous transponder flight buss circuit breaker OPEN, and
the S-band FM transmitter/DSE flight bus circuit breaker OPEN.
Over.
SC
Okay. TV rendezvous transponder flight
bus OPEN, TV S-band FM transmitter/DSE flight bus OPEN on
panel 225.
CAP COM Okay. That's correct, Jack. Now we'll
go into the main bus power up procedure. And the first step
there is on panel 5. We want the bat charger, bat A charged
circuit breaker closed, and the BAT B charge circuit breaker
closed. Over.
SC
Okay. BAT chargers, BAT A charged
BAT B charged, both closed on panel 5.
CAP COM That's affirmative. We need them closed
to power the switches. Next on panel 5 we want the EPS sensor
signal MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breaker CLOSED. Over.
SC
Okay. Panel 5 (garble) and EPS sensor's
signals MAIN A AND MAIN B CLOSED.
CAP COM Okay. That's affirmative. We need
them closed so you can read out your volts and AMPS. Next step
on panel 250, we want circuit breaker BAT A, power, entry and
post landing and BAT B power, entry and post landing CLOSED. Over.
SC
Okay on panel 250 (garble) BAT A,
power and post landing CLOSED, BAT B power, entry and post landing
CLOSED
CAP COM That's affirmative. And at that point
we'd like you to check the BAT plus voltages on both BAT plus's
to make sure we don't have any shorts. Over.
SC
Okay (garble) Bat plus A and Bat plus B.
CAP COM That's affirmative. The next step on

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-15-70 CST 11:14A, GET 94:01:10 397/2
CAP COM On panel 275 circuit breaker MAIN A Bat plus A
closed and circuit breaker MAIN B Bat plus B closed. Over.
SC
Okay. Panel 275 circuit breaker MAIN BAT A
plus A CLOSED, BAT Circuit Breaker MAIN B CLOSED.
CAPCOM That's affirmative. Next step on
panel 5. We want the main BUS tie AC Switch to the BAT AC
position, and verify proper voltage on MAIN BUS A, and read
the AMPS on BAT A to make sure we don't have a short. Over.
SC
(garble)
CAP COM
(garble)
SC
Okay how do you read that?
CAPCOM That's better, Jack. Go ahead with
your readback.
SC
Okay. MAIN B US tie AC ON, MAIN BUS A
current and voltage.
CAP COM Okay, that's affirmative. The next
step will be the main bus tie B C switch to the ON position
and read MAIN B voltage and battery B amp as above. Over.
SC
Okay, main bus BC ON, main B voltage
is ON.
CAP COM Okay. That is correct. Then to
reconfigure from this configuration, Jack. We want you to
leave the main bus tie switches in the ON position and pull
the circuit breakers out in reverse order that we had you
close them. Over and do you want me to read them up individually?
SC
Let me see if I've got it here. I go down
to panel 275, (garble) open Main bus A and B and go down to 250 and
(garble) go up on panel 5 pull ECS Main A and Main B and
battery charger BAT B charged, Battery charge BAT A charged.
I don't know whether you want me to close rendezvous radar
transponder flight BUS and S-band transponder. (Garble)
CAP COM Okay, Jack. We don't want you to
close those last 2. Those are changes to your basic con-
figuration and we want to leave them open now. Over.
SC
Okay, I'll do that. Was the readback okay.
CAP COM That's correct. Everything was 100
percent, and we'll wait to hear from you.
SC
Okay, Joe. And just for confirmation,
I went through (garble) you gave me. We are in exactly that
configuration with 1 exception, and that is over on panel 382,
these 2 acumulators are in the OFF position so that if we need
any more water we can get it.
CAP COM Okay, Roger, Jack. Copy that. On panel 382.
You've left the H20 accumulator valves in the OFF position
and we concur.

And we think that - -
SC
Okay, and there's one other thing
that I don't know whether you're aware of. We have no lithium
hydroxide canisters in Panel 26 the canisters panel. So
when we get ready to power up, you'll have to remind us when
you want us to amp.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. We copy that. That's
correct and I'll add that to our basic checklist S O that we
won't forget it.

then back to the 275 breakers, thistime we find the BAT BUS
volts 32.0 on A, ZERO amps and 37.0 on B, zero amps.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. We have (garble)
there and I want to be sure that we get these numbers right.

entry breaker. The dead battery bus volt is 32.3 on A, 37.0
on B. Then he puts in the P 75 breaker tieing the bat to the
main bus. This configuration main A is at 32.0 volts, zero
amps. Main B is at 37.0 volts, zero amps. It looks like the

CAP COM We are reading 0.2 on our C02 sets
here and we're all delighted, it seems to be working
fine.
SC
Boy, that is great.
CAP COM And Fred, Houston. In a little while
here I'm going to have a procedure that I want to read up
to you and have you copy down for future use. It's a
procedure for powering the command module main bus off the
LM and it's something that we feel that's going to come in
real handy later on for such things as topping off the
command module entry batteries and also possibly for doing
some preheating and preliminary powering up of the command
module before we get rid of the LM. We'll have that for you
in probably 10 or 15 minutes. Over.
SC
Okay, okay, Joe. That's good. (garbled)
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM
Okay, Fred, our procedure generating mill
has generated another very short one for you here. It's a
procedure for getting an onboard readout -
SC
Stand by one, Joe.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, Joe, go ahead.
CAP COM
Okay, Fred, this is a procedure for
getting the readout of the descent propellant tank temps.
It's no big problem, but our LM people say that the bottom
of the descent stage is probably cooling off and we just
want to verify that the descent water tank will be okay.
Right now it looks as though it won't freeze until several
hours after it's empty, but we want to have you read these
temperatures out to us S O we can see how good our predictions
are. The procedure is on panel 16, close the propellant
display/engine override logic circuit breaker. Over.
SC
Okay, the propellant displays override
circuit breakers are closed. (garbled) the propellant.
CAP COM Right, Fred, the next step is simply
to turn the propellant temp press monitor switch to descent 1,
read the fuel and OX temps, turn it to descent 2, read the
fuel and OX temps and tell us what they are.

--- PAGE 556 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 11:44A GET 94:31:05 400/2

CAP COM
Okay, Fred, we're (garbled)
SC
Okay, how do you read now?

That's better. Go ahead.
SC
Okay, you got 66.5 on descent 1 fuel temp,
oxidizer temp is 66 degrees.
CAPCOM
Okay, and I'll - -
SC
Tank 2 fuel is reading okay, descent 2
fuel is reading 68 degrees, oxidizer 65 degrees.
CAPCOM Okay, copy that Fred. Thank you. We'd
like you to pull the circuit breaker and we'll probably come
to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another check.

Okay, Joe, how you read on the aft OMNI?
CAP COM You're okay now. Go ahead.
SC
Okay, after battery B power entry
full slant on, then I want to push the panel 275 DC BAT BUS
B.
CAP COM That's right, then you go to verify
main B US voltage LM power to CSM and then on panel 275
circuit breaker main B BAT B US B, open. Over.

circuit breaker BAT B power entry post landing, open and
verify main BUS B voltage.
SC
Okay, panel 250 main BUS B power
post landing open then verify the main BUS voltage.
CAP COM Okay, that's correct. The last steps
are to get the LM back on descent batteries. The first
step is BAT 1, 2, 3 and 4 high voltage on. Over
SC
Okay, then the next step is the last
step, that's BAT 1,2,3,4 high voltage on.

docking window here and I can see another
good shower of particles coming out of the service module
and position this time appears to be on the other side, before
we'd always seen them out of window 1 and we're up looking
at it from here, it looks like it would be down below window
6 in the service module. Jack's going upstairs to see what
it looks like up there.
CAP COM Okay, good deal. We copied that, Fred, and
to show you how relaxed we are about the entry, Ken is looking
at - - giving you guys a chance to - prior to going into entry
prep to send a few pictures of the service module.
SC
Ken is -
CAPCOM
Yeah, he's got all that film up there and he
doesn't want to waste it.
SC
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want me to do a
PLSS EVA shoot your pictures or something.
CAP COM
Okay, okay.
SC
Right, we got a lot of pictures.
SC
I guess I agree with Joe, I'd like to document
some way (garble)
CAP COM
Yeah, we think it'd be a lot of help.

(Garble)
SC
Okay, how's that.
CAPCOM
That's better.
SC
Okay, the waste transferred into the condensate
works real well, Bill.
CAPCOM
Okay, forget.

So, I guess we can keep Fido happy with no
overboard dump.
CAP COM
Roger, that.
SC
That brings about one more possibility, Joe.
CAP COM
Say again, Fred.
SC
Brings up another possibly, now we've got
all that stowed and the bags and the condensate can and it's prob-
ably blow through the (garble) sublimator and work on waste water.
CAP COM It might work if we had to do it, Fred.
Right now we're looking at a comfortable excess of water
through the sublimator. We were talking among ourselves this
morning about having you try out the PLSS to assent tank
water transfer situation and we decided not to do it, not
to recommend it because we figure it'd take us 30 hours to
empty one of the assent tanks, which you have to do in order
to get PLSS water to it and we'd rather use the descent water
and we don't think we've gotten any sweat.
SC
Okay, Joe. I don't think there's any ques-
tion about it (GARBLE) that might be indicated.
CAPCOM Okay, copy that.

This is Apollo Control. 95 hours 30 minutes
ground elapsed time. Present thinking on the midcourse cor-
rection which would bring Apollo 13 back into the Earth's inter-
cepting corridor, would be a Lm maneuver, propulsion maneuver
of about 7 feet per second at 104 hours ground elapsed time
and would return the spacecraft to entry corridor shooting
for a flight path angle of about minus 6-1/2 degrees on all
lunar missions to date, with a few exceptions, during the
trans-earth coast phase some sort of midcourse correction
has been necessary to get back on to the corridor depending
on the accuracy of the transearth injection. This particular
mission is certainly no different. Spacecraft communicator
Joe Kerwin is away from the console at the moment, after having
read up some additional checklist changes. We are continuing
to monitor the air-to-ground. Kerwin returning to the con-
sole. If the midcoure correction in this trans earth phase
is delayed beyond 104 hours to the second one, it's in con-
tention of second time of 118 hours, it would be somewhat
greater magnitude more in the neighborhood of 40 feet per
second. With the 7 foot per second midcourse correction at
104 hours, the vacuum perigee would be around 20 nautical
miles. Flight path angle of minus 6.51 degrees. AT 95 hours
32 minutes, ground elapsed time and standing by this is
Apollo Control.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 96 hours.
At the present time the discussions here in the Mission Con-
trol Room about the midcourse correction, are beginning to
firm up toward a definite time, heretofore, the times under
discussion were 10 - 104 hours and 113 hours. Right now it's
shaping up to look like we'll do the midcourse correction to
bend the trajectory back to the entry corridor with a vacuum
perigee of around 20 nautical miles. The burn would be at
105:30 ground elapsed time; descent propulsion system burn
7.6 feet per second; 14.8 seconds duration. this burn would
be - is being timed to coincide with the estimated time that
the burst disk in the supercritical helium in the lunar
module will give way, so that the effects on the trajectory
would be lessened in having both the burn and any perturbations
(garble) in the trajectory come at the same time. The vent from
the supercritical helium now is non-propulsive, that is, there's
a T in the line and it should cancel out any DELTA-V added
by the venting, however, there's somewhat - a certain amount
of uncertainty in this regard. At any rate, having the burn
and the burst disk event near the same time frame gets both
of these events out of the way and it gives a good long bit
of tracking to pin down what the new trajectory will be. We're
now showing 0.1 millimeters in mercury partial pressure carbon
dioxide in the lunar module. So, apparently the shade tree
engineering using the command module lithium hydroxide cannisters
in the plastic bag and the suit hoses, is working out all
right. And at 96 hours, 3 minutes ground elapsed time, this
is Apollo Control.

This is Apollo Control at 96 hours
15 minutes ground elapsed time. There's some white sacks
with sandwiches being brought into the room by a young lady.
Getting back to midcourse correction in the transearth
coast phase here in Apollo 13, the current thinking is to do
a descent propulsion system maneuver at about 105 hours
30 minutes ground elapsed time. 7.6 feet per second. The
burn time of 14.8 seconds. Apollo 8, back in December 1968,
did a similar burn in about a similar time. However, it
was a command module or service module RCS burn of 4.8
seconds 4.8 feet per second at 10358. The burn is
intentionally timed to the estimated time frame in which
the lunar module super critical helium burst disc is suppose
to let go. It's not anticipated that this burst disc, the
venting of the super critical helium will cause any
perturbations to the trajectory and that vent outlet has
a T on it and thereby cancels out any propulsion. It's
called an non-propulsive vent. Having the burn and the
burst disc take place in the same time frame will allow
the tracking after these events to provide a good handle
on spacecraft trajectory for refining the - into the recorder
and calculations towards entry. There's quite a bit
propulsion available out of the spacecraft up to some 28
feet per second still available with the vehicle that
weighs in the neighborhood of 87,000 pounds. For the small
RCS thrusters on the lunar module, 28 feet per second
available out of that system. Still a great deal of
propulsion available in the descent propulsion system and
one as yet untapped system. That's the ascent propulsion
engine in the upper stage of the lunar module which likely
won't even be used at all. Rather quiet now in the air
to ground circuit. Taking a lunch break here in Mission
Control. Sandwiches were brought in as mentioned earlier
and most of the people are taking this opportunity to
have a mid-afternoon snack. At 96 hours 18 minutes and
standing by, this is Apollo Control.

SC
No. How are we going to get a

ideas on that and the last one I heard is to power up the

PAO
This is Apollo Control 96 hours
53 minutes ground elapsed time. Spacecraft communicator
Vance Brand has releived Joe Kerwin at that post, the space-
craft communicators on a different shift schedule than the
rest of the Flight Controllers. To go back again, once over
lightly with the midcourse correction upcoming.. Repeat the
current thinking is to do a midcourse correction burn at
105 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time, the descent pro-
pulsion system of the Lunar Module would do the burn - the
velocity change would be 7.6 feet per second. This burn
would place the Apollo 13 spacecraft back on the entry
corridor for entry into the South Central Pacific. Another
aspect of timing the maneuver at 105:30 instead of the
earlier discussed 104 hours, is that it is expected that
super-critical helium burst disk in the lunar module descent
stage is likely to let go at about - about this time frame
105:30 and by doing the maneuver and the - and having the
burst disk rupture at this time would put both of these events
close together so it wouldn't be expecting the burst disk
to go which in turn may or may not effect the trajectory as
far as tracking concerns, so this would get them both behind
and an accurate tracking state vector of the spacecraft could
be measured. It's expected that the new thinking on the mid-
course correction will be passed up to the crew before too
long.
PAO
The midcourse correction burn made
earlier at 79 hours and 28 minutes transferred Apollo 13 from
a hybrid nonfree return trajectory to a free return trajec-
tory. The next maneuver at Pericynthion plus two hours
transferred back from one free return to another with a change
in the landing point and landing time. We're continuing to
stand by. The velocity now showing 4068 feet per second as
Apollo 13 continues to accelerate, now that it is back into
the Earths sphere of influence. Some 172 937 miles out from
Earth. At 96 hours 57 minutes ground elapsed time and standing
by, this is Apollo Control.

the SHe tank is susposed to vent, in that way, we hope
that we have, you would be powered up and you would have
control when the venting occurs, in case you were tossed
around a little bit. Over.
AQUARIUS Okay, understand. Philosophy on the
mid course is doing it prior to venting of the SHe tank
which means we'll be doing this around 105 hours, I
suppose or 105 30 and so I'll have control of the spacecraft
if it should give us some perturbation.

it's about where he would expect to see it. He was pleased
with that 820 pounds per square inch reading. The repress
package consists of three one pound oxygen bottles, in the
command module. It's used to quickly repressurize the
command module after it has been depressurized. The name
repress comes from repressurization. In addition to these
three one pound bottles of oxygen in the command module, the
surge tank contains an additional three pounds of oxygen
for the command module. Flight Director, Jerry Griffin, and
his gold team have releived Glenn Lunney and his black team.

This is Apollo Control at 99 hours, 1 minute.
Apollo 13 now is 167 992 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity
4154 feet per second. As you heard on air-ground, we do
intend to - play the ignition time for the midcourse correc-
tion rather loosely. Basing it on the predicted supercritical
helium tank burst disk going as the pressure in that tank
rises to the point where it will burst the disk and vent the
helium overboard. However, we burned the descent propulsion
engine which is pressurized by this helium enough times now
that - we have enough helium entrapped in the propellant
tanks - known as blowdown capability or ullage capability,
for 800 feet per second DELTA-V SO there will be no problem
in - in loosing the - the remainder of the helium from the
helium tank. Based on a prediction of 106 hours at the present
time for the helium tank relieving, we would expect to do
the burn somewhere around 105-1/2 hours. If the helium tank
relieves earlier than predicted, we would do the burn as
quickly after that as operationally possible. We'd like to
keep - to do the burn within a half an hour of the tank
pressure relieving, if possible. This is a non-propulsive
venting, but it will probably cause some attitude excursions,
and they would like to have the spacecraft powered up with
the crew in control of the - Aquarius when the venting occurs.
The midcourse correction itself will be a straight forward
maneuver, estimated right now that it will be on the order
of 7 to 8 feet per second. About a 15 second burn, using

- For the secondary guidance system -
backup guidance system of the Lunar Module for this burn. The
AGS takes less power than PGNCS and we would like to hold the
power usage down. And this burn is well within the capability
of the AGS as far as accuracy. We will probably burn on
time rather than velocity acheived. It will be done with the
throttle in the minimum position. The Flight Director Jerry
Griffin has been taking a status report from his Flight
Controllers. The C02 lithium hydroxide procedure worked out
with the hoses and the - the makeshift method to run the
cabin air pass the Command Module, lithium hydroxide cannisters
appears to be working very well. The C02 in the cabin is now
up to only 2/10 of a - of millimeters of mercury. Based on
present usage rates we have enough water to last until an
elapsed time of 165 hours 14 minutes. The water rate will go
up slightly during - during burns. We expect to use about
7 pounds of water for midcourse. We have enough oxygen to
last until an elapsed time of 273 hours 27 minutes, under the
present usage rates. And enough electrical power for 209 hours
8 minutes. We calculate we have enough lithium hydroxide for
100 - for 164 hours from now, that is not a GET time, we have
enough remaining for 164 hours. All of these consumables are
well above what is required for a 142 hours elapsed time
landing.

CAP COM
- (garble) minutes.
CAP COM
I want -
SC
Is that the first step, Charlie?
CAP COM That's affirmative. What we're trying to do
here, is we're getting you setup in an attitude, SO you can
damp your rates and come out of PTC; and this is the con-
figuration I'm reading you now, the next - and the next 6 lines,
the procedure for getting you into a configuration to damp
the rates, and stop PTC. Over.
SC
Okay, for the first, the thing will be to -
get her to AUTO on the RCS system A and B?
CAP COM It's the varify that the heaters have been
in AUTO for 15 minutes. Back on the first page of this
procedure you put the heaters in AUTO, and you pushed the
breakers in, and we'd like for them to warm up the quads for
15 minutes before we start to stop at stopping PTC. Over.
SC
Roger, varify heaters RCS, ON for 15 min-
utes.
CAP COM Okay, step 2. Balance couple, OFF; DEADBAND,
MINIMUM; attitude control; pitch and roll to PULSE; yaw to
DIRECT; mode control AGS at HOLD; guidance control to AGS;
damp rates pitch and roll with the TTCA; yaw with the ACA
with the Earth in the front window. Over.
SC
Okay, let's see if I got it. Step 2 is
balance couples, OFF; DEADBAND, MIN; attitude control pitch
and yaw at PULSE; yaw, DIRECT. Mode control will be in AGS
at HOLD; guidance control will be in AGS; we'll damp the
rates pitch and roll with the TTCA; and the yaw with the ACA;
and we'll probably have to have some reference point, SO I
have to try and stop on the Earth. Over.
CAP COM Roger, Jim. We were hoping that in your PTC
that you occasionally see the Earth coming through the win-
dow, and if that's true, then we'd like you to have to just
damp the rates with the Earth in the forward window. And
then we'll give you the burn attitude, via the forward win-
dow, on the Earth, momentarily. Over.
SC
Roger.
CAP COM Okay, that was the entire procedure for damp-
ing the rates, only though I only gave you, said it was
step 2; that was the entire procedure. Now, continuing on
to what's printed on page 29; correction, you had one error
in the readback under attitude control; it was pitch and roll
to PULSE; yaw to DIRECT. Continuing on, on page 29 with the
printed procedure; the first four lines, scratch. Step 3;
scratch. Under AGS activation; one change, add a step:
first step will be varify ASA CB16 in for 10 minutes. The
rest of the AGS activation is as printed. Over.
SC
Okay, varify ASA circuit breaker 16 in for
10 minutes; and I take it 10 minutes back in our procedures
we'll have a note saying to put that in.

--- PAGE 596 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 5:28P GET 100:15 428/2
CAP COM It's - the circuit breaker goes in on the
circuit breaker activation page, Jim. So, by the time
we get here and have the rates all damped we feel that -
that the EPIPA's will be up to temperature by this time,
and we can go ahead and turn it - turn the AGS on, at
this time. Over. But we just want you to varify that.
SC
Okay, and one other question, Charlie -
I'd like to know if the note you gave me about damping
the rates is before the other information on page 29?
CAP COM That's affirmative. Add that into the
top - -

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 5:33P GET 100:20:00 429/1
SC
arrange is before the other information
on page 29.
CAP COM That's affirmative. Add that into the
top of the page. What we are really doing let's put it in
to write before the AGS activation. The other procedure on
the top of the page belongs with the DAP set gimbal trim and
we're just omitting all of that procedure. So the addition
on the damping the right should really go in right before the
AGS activation. Over.
SC
Understand.
CAP COM What we are really trying to do is get you
in a posture so that when you see the earth come through the
window, you can damper out and hold the earth in the window.
Proceeding on to the rest of page 29 under RCS press, scratch
the entire 3 steps as printed. On page 30 scratch step 4
under the RCS press. Over.
SC
Roger. Under AGS activation I included
that step on the ASA circuit breaker and will do step 1 and
2 other AGS activation, but then we will scratch steps 1,
2 and 3 in the RCS press and on page 30 we will scratch
step 4.
CAP COM Affirm. Under DEPS press, step 1, line 1
scratch. Line 4 descent helium rig 1 talk back barber pole.
Under step 2 scratch, step 3 scratch, landing gear deployed,
scratch. Over.
SC
Okay. Under DIPS press we'll scratch the
first line and we'll have the descent helium rig gone back
to barber pole. We'll scratch steps 2 and 3 and we'll scratch
the landing gear deployed.
CAP COM Roger. Now we got on the back of page 30,
Jim, you've got a blank page on your checklist or should have
and we'd like to add a procedure to get you to burn attitude.
Over.
SC
Okay. A procedure to get the burn attitude.
CAP COM Okay. First statement is a statement
verify AGS and operate for 5 minutes. Then we go to AGS
address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero. Attitude control
PITCH and ROLL to PULSE. YAW mode control. Maneuver using
TTCA PITCH and ROLL. The computer is controling YAW but you
can override with ACA. You with me? Over.
SC
Okay, Charlie. I'm with you so far.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. When in attitude ACA out of
detent to zero air needles. Then set event timer and we'll
give you a countdown on that when you get to that step. Over.
SC
Okay. When in attitude ACA out of
detent to no needles, and set DET.

CAP COM Roger. Now the burn attitude will be
coming up on a pad but basically we are looking for a local
horizontal retrograde burn which means that using a COAS if
you put the horizontal line on the COAS on the horns of the
earth and then ROLL to place the X-Axis in the direction
of the sun, that will put us in both burn attitude and you
can check that -

CAP COM - we'll that will put us in both
burn attitude and you can check that via the sun which will
be in the AOT detent 2. Should lie right along the cursor
at the top. We'll have some more words on that for you
momentarily. Now, I'd like to go on to page 31 if you're
ready. Over.
SC
Okay. I figure - I have a handle
on the attitude of - the way the earth should look in the
COAS and you're going to give me some words of what the
sun would look like in the AOT. Is that right?
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. We haven't
got a picture of it yet. It's going to be in the top
part of the COAS - correction, top part of the AOT at the
top of the the top of detent 2 and the top part of the
AOT and it should in attitude if you're right on the sun
should split the cursor though that roll angle is not too
critical if we're in about 10 degrees, we'll be okay. We -
but I think, we think you should be able to get it better
than that. On page 31, under the DPS burn technique, you
can scratch the bottom part below the little diagram there
since the gimbal is locked. Over.
SC
Understand scratch the bottom part
underneath the diagram because the gimbal is locked.
CAP COM That's affirmative and since the
gimbal was trimmed out, at the big burn yesterday, we
should be still through the CG and we'd like to make sure
that Jack sits in the same place for this burn that he did
yesterday and in that way we'll you should have no trouble
controlling attitude. Now I'm ready to go over to page
32. Over.
SC
Okay. Let me see if I have that
right. Now you want Jack to sit in the same attitude so
that the gimbals are the same place and you don't have
trouble controlling attitude. I got it.
CAP COM Okay. Now page 32. Top of the page.
First line, scratch VERB 76. Third line, mode control AGS
at hold. At minus 6 minutes, scratch line 1, 2 and at
burn attitude scratch VE RB 40 NO UN 20. Scratch line 2, 3
and 4. Now at burn attitude, we want you to do a 400 plus
5 and then a Vert - a 400 plus 0. And we have a caution
note at this point. Over.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. The caution is after 400
plus 0, do not go out of detent on ACA again. Over.
SC
Okay. After the last 400 plus 0,
do not go out of detent with ACA. Is that correct?
CAP COM That's a rog, Jim. What happens
is of course we said that when you go out of detent, you

--- PAGE 600 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 5:39P GET 100:26:00 430/2
CAP COM - reset the AGS ATT needles and you
and you loose your attitude reference. You establish a
new attitude reference and it might not be the burn attitude
since at the point we're controlling attitude with the TTCA.
Now picking up with the VERB 37 ENTER, scratch. Scratch
everything down to the 404 plus 0 and we want you to perform
those AGS steps with 404 down through 470. Over.

to 10 percent. Now we want you to add a line, shut - it's a
shutdown criteria shutdown on burn time minus 1 second. Over.
SC
Okay, the shutdown is on burn time
minus 1 second. Let me give you an example if we have a 30
second burn we are going to shutdown at 29 seconds, is that
correct?
CAP COM That's affirmative. We'll give you the
PAD - it will be coming up here from FIDO in a couple of hours,
and I guess we stabalize out on our tracking, the reason for
if you're ready to copy out a couple of more steps here and

CAP COM - the ASA breaker has been out for SO long,
we're not real confident that our AGS PIPPA's are going to be
super short. So we want to make sure that we just get a
burn - time, no overburn; so we're shutting down on burn
time minus 1 second. And then that will allow us a plus
X translation to trim 470 if it looks okay. If we had a

on our command module to try to trim it out, so that's our
reasoning there. Over.
SC
Okay, understand.
CAP COM Okay, picking up in the middle of the page,
that - a block CSM resume attitude control; scratch. Scratch
the next line; probe VE RB 96. Scratch the third line;
propellant quantity monitor, OFF. Over.
SC
Okay, we'll scratch the blocks, and we'll
scratch the probe VE RB 96; then we'll scratch propellant
quantity monitor, OFF.
CAP COM Roger. And at the bottom of that page, I
have a procedure for you to reestablish PTC. Over.
SC
To reestablish PTC. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, first line - attitude control 3 to
PULSE; line 2, roll with the TTCA until attitude is roll
plus or minus 90; pitch 0; yaw 0. Over.
SC
Okay, set one attitude control 3 to PULSE;
2, roll with the TTCA (static) pitch is 0 and yaw is 0, and
I think that's because the AGS (garble).
CAP COM That's affirm, Jim. You broke up there for
a minute, Jim. We'll do that on the AGS ball from the
burn attitude we just want you to roll either way 90 degrees,
keep pitch 0 and yaw 0. Now, step 3; when at when at
attitude ACA out of detent. Step 4; attitude control yaw to
MODE CONTROL; when rates are less than 0.05 attitude control
yaw to PULSE.
SC
Okay, Charlie. Can you hold up here a second,
I'll log 2.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
I'll start with step 3, again, when attitude -
when at attitude ACA out of detent.
CAP COM That's Roger. Next step 4; attitude control
to YAW; correction, attitude control yaw to MODE CONTROL.
Over.
SC
Okay, step 4 is attitude control yaw to MODE
CONTROL.
CAP COM Roger, step 5; when rates are less than 0.05
degrees per second; attitude control yaw to PULSE.
SC
Okay, when rates are less than 0.05 degrees
per second attitude control yaw to PULSE.
CAP COM Roger. Step 6. Spin up to 10ths degree

CAPCOM That's affirmed. Step 8. Power down
per power - correction. Power down per contingency checklist
page power 5. Over.
SC
Okay. As (garble) power down per
contingency checklist. Power 5 and I take it that's been
revamped considering our situation. Over.
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. That's the
one we gave you last night after the big burn and we'll use
that one as modified by - by us. This - we tried this
PTC under AGS in the simulator and of course no slosh or
anything but it seemed to work pretty good by nulling the
rates using the TTCA in pitch and roll and letting the AGS
do it in yaw. You'll null the rates by looking at the
arrow needles and just watching those and when they don't
when they stop moving and you've got it within the limits
of what we want. Over.
SC
Okay. And I guess Charlie you have
no - you haven't had hold mode in pitch and roll at all in
this configuration we're in or do we have to use the TTCA?
CAP COM We feel like we have to use the TTCA.
The AGS gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this
configuration. It'll hold it in yaw but it won't in pitch
and roll. Over.
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM And you'll have during the burn
of course you'll be controlling pitch and roll via the
arrow needles with the TTCA also and it's the little scheme
that we've practiced in some of the sims. Over.
SC
Right. Understand.
SC
And Houston, want to make sure that
we allow enough time to get to the proper attitude for the
burn so that we can be sure we have established the proper
attitude and don't have to rust the burn.
CAP COM Rog, Jim. We're looking right now
tentatively at starting this about 45 minutes before the
burn and our sensitivity is off not too bad on this
burn we can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our
DELTA V. Over.
SC
Okay. Fine. And do you have a handle
on just how long the burn will be?
SC
In times.
CAP COM It's looking like it about 7.8 seconds
and about 15 - correction 7.8 feet per second and about
15 seconds. Over.
SC
In about 18 seconds?
CAP COM
Negative. 15. 15.
SC
15. Okay.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 5:57P GET 100:44:00 433/2
CAP COM And one other point is it - - we'd
like to remind you that this is going to be in blow down
and both regs be closed but we've got plenty at the 10 per-
cent.
SC
Understand.
CAP COM
And Jim in the simulator, with our
configuration that we had here the thing is real stable at
10 percent so we don't think you'll have to twig very much
at all using the TTCA's. Over.
SC
Okay. Understand.
CAPCOM
And I'll give you back Vance. Thank
you.
SC
And thank you.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM
Jim, regarding your number 2 battery
we think that it's probably a sensor failure, a temperature
sensor failure that's caused this alarm rather than an
actual over temp of the battery. The reason being that
we haven't seen any higher temperatures in the GLYCOL loop.
We expect to put the battery back on about 101 hours. That'll
be about 10 minutes and then we'll look at it some more there.
Over.
SC
Okay. Considering number 2 battery
you think it might be a sensor failure because you haven't
seen any changes and you're going to put the battery back
on the line in about 10 minutes.
CAP COM That's affirmed.
SC
Okay.

Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Jim.
SC
For information Vance, oh about a
half hour ago, I guess Jack and I couldn't see constalations
at certain spacecraft attitudes stars, we could see Scorpio
and Sagittarius and we could see Adria or Acrux and
Alpha Centura (garble) stars of that magnitude and our venting
has stopped which allows us now to differentiate between
the particles and the stars.
CAP COM Roger, copy understand. You can see
the stars pretty well. Were you at that time in an attitude
facing away from the Sun, I presume this is very attitude
critical.
SC
Yea it is somewhat, Vance. If we
have the Sun shining off the quads it sort of ruins our
vision and also the Earth and the Moon are in the general
field of view and we can't see anything.
CAP COM
Okay, thank you.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Vance.
CAP COM
Jim, we're ready to put that battery
back on the line. Request you open the cross tie bal
LOAD circuit breaker panel 16 and then put back BAT 2 back
on the line.
SC
Okay, first of all we will open the
balance quad tie breaker and then we will proceed.
CAP COM That's affirm.
SC
Okay, the cross tie balance load circuit
breaker is now Vance. Now you want us to put
battery 2 back on, is that affirm?
CAP COM
Did you say it was in, or did you
pull it out?
SC
No, it's in, do you want it out?
CAP COM
That's affirm, we'd like it out and
then BAT 2 on the line.
SC
Okay, coming up.
SC
BAT 2 is on the line.
SC
We have a master alarm and a battery
light.
CAP COM
Copy. And we think that's probably
an indication of the sensor problem, but stand by.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM Jim, it looks to us like your battery
is good, that this is in fact a sensor problem, therefore,
I request you close the cross tie bal LOAD on circuit
breaker on panel 16 advise.

malfunction indication on any of your batteries now, but we
can watch it from the ground. Over.
SC
Okay, we'll close the cross tie bal
LOAD circuit breaker at this time.
CAP COM
Roger, copy.
SC
That's closed and we don't have any
warning on any of the batteries, but you can monitor from the
ground.
CAP COM
That's affirm.
CAP COM And Jim we have a lengthy procedure
here for powering up the CSM and turning on instrumentation
so we can check the TM and this will take a large peice of
scratch paper whenever your ready to copy
SC
This is to power up the CSM.
CAP COM
That's affirm.

Aquarius.
CAP COM
Okay, read you loud and clear, Aquarius.
Is it cool in there now?
SC
Okay, yea, it's pretty cool. This is
the third officer on this LM crew here. Ready to copy.
CAP COM Okay. Jack, this is a lengthy procedure
take probably 2 or 3 pages it assumes that you are in your
nominal configuration, which was or in your day flying
configuration, which was sent up to you earlier today.
SC
Okay, I can verify that we are in
that configuration, except for panel 382 the water accumulator,
which I have left off in case we wanted to get some more
drinking water out of the Command Module and I'll - -

Yes, that's fine.
CAP COM Okay, and leave a little space if you can to
the right of these because when we talk about the backup
procedure, why then we can just use the same listing, and
I'll - I'll tell you open instead of close these circuit
breakers, or at least, most of them. Over.

Next panel 275, CB Main B BAT Bus B to close CB inverter
power 2 Main B to close. Okay. Incidently anything that
I've given you up to now is not sequenced critical. But from
now on this should be - you should be sure to do it in the
sequence we give you. Why don't you read that back, Jack.
SC
Okay, let me give you all of panel
225 again, CB flight Bus Main B close CB CTE Main B closed
On panel 250, CB BAT B BAT charge, that should be BAT C - -
Charlie, isn't it BAT charge EDS 2 closed?
CAP COM
That's right.
SC
CB BAT B power entery.
CAP COM
Okay, that should be BAT Charlie.

Okay. Now comes the one that I didn't
understand you. Did you say go over to MDC 5 and AC inverter
AC Bus 1 reset that center. And then back to MDC 3 up
telemetry command reset then off and then select best
omni.
CAP COM Roger, the reset is correct and let me
recheck this, stand by. Jack, we were incorrect on panel 5,
that should have been panel 3.
SC
Okay, that's good. I got it.
CAP COM Okay, now when you are in this configura-
tion the following onboard read outs are required. Panel 3,
BAT C voltage, PYRO BAT A voltage, PYRO BAT B voltage. SPS
helium pressure and the following readouts on Panel 101.
CMRCS injector temperatures. Those are positions 5 Charlie,
5 Delta, 6 Alpha, 6 Bravo, 6 Charlie, 6 Delta and the battery
manifold pressure, which is 4 Alpha. And standing by to read
back.

Okay, youu want me to read back on
MDC 3 BAT B voltage, PYRO A voltage, PYRO B voltage SPS
helium pressure on Panel 101 Command Module RCS injector
temperaturee 5 Charlie, 5 Dog, 6 Alpha, 6 Baker, 6 Charlie,
6 Dog. The battery manifold pressure 4 Alpha.
CAP COM Okay, now that was correct but I want
to recheck the very first one, that was BAT Charlie, voltage,
is that what you read back?
SC
Okay, BAT Charlie, voltage. Seems like
we're having a difference I can't understand BAT Charlie
from BAT Dog.
CAP COM Okay, now that is the complete procedure
for getting into it as far as getting into it is concerned.
What I will give you now is how to back out of it after you're
through with your readings. Are you ready to copy?
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay, now you'll back out fairly quickly
after you go into this procedure. All we will need is about
5 minutes of TM and so if you are ready to copy here it comes.
SC
Go ahead.

CAP COM Okay, next panel 250, CB BATT Bravo; power
entry post landing to OPEN; standby one.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. What I just gave you now on the
back out is the only thing that's order critical. From here
on, you can go to the steps for initiating the procedure, and
back track, in other words, you should go to each of the
panels that I read up, and put the circuit breakers back to
the baseline configuration, or the switches. Over.
SC
Okay. Okay, here's Jack says here's the
sequence critical step; power amp, OFF; transponder, OFF;
AC inverter 2, OFF; and the last one on panel 250; CB BATT
Baker power entry in post landing, OPEN; and then hit the
steps in reverse order that you gave them to me, and back
out, like then, I wouldn't start on - FEC 3 up telemetry -
to OFF; and then AC inverter - AC1 BUS 1 to OFF; and the AC
inverter 2 to OFF; AC inverter 2 MAIN B to OFF; is that the
type of order that you want to back out of?
CAP COM That's affirm, but - just for kicks let's go
through these panels again, and I'll give you the the
position, just to make sure there can be no doubt.
SC
Okay, go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, and once again, in the in the area
where I said order was not critical, it's still not critical
when you back out. But now I'll go ahead. Okay, panel 4;
TEL COMM group 1; AC1 - will not be AC1 it'll go to OFF.
Panel 5; all circuit breakers on that panel, which were
positioned will now come to OPEN. Over.

will go to OFF; and up telemetry command reset will go OFF.
CAP COM That's correct, Jack. Okay, that's it. And,
I think we're about ready to go with this procedure whenever
you are.
SC
Okay, first we got to go through that procedure
to power the CSM from the LM, is that Charlie?
CAP COM No, no, this is independent of power from the
LM. this is a - this is purely a CSM -
SC
Oh, okay.
CAP COM - this is purely a CSM power up, SO we can
take a look at your telemetry and see how cold the vehicle
is, and that sort of thing.
SC
Okay, it's going in work.
SC
Okay, now I won't I won't have any voice
with you, so - Is that right? You don't want me to get
connected up - You want me to just take these readings and
come back and tell you what I have, huh?
CAPCOM
That's affirm, there be no voice. And -
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay, in work.
CAP COM
I - we presume, though, that there'll be
somebody in the LM that we can call if we have to get word
to you.
SC
Oh, yes. There'll be somebody to be standing
by, and they '11 run up into the bed room, and tell me to stop
what I'm doing.

And, I'm copying down the reestablishing
PTC maneuver that Charlie gave me. Step five was when
rates are less than twice 05 degrees per second. Attitude
control is YAW to PULSE. And, it well - might to get that
rate down to .05 feet per second. I rated the meter, at the
best, at .1 of a degree.

Go ahead.
CAP COM Jim, this has been tried in the
simulator by Charlie and others and what they recommend is
that you null your rates on the arrow needles until you
see no movement whatsoever and then wait another couple of
minutes and that should do it. That's the only way we can
tell. Over.
SC
Okay. I'll give it the old college try.
CAPCOM Okay. And if you can't attain that
why of course just the best you can do. We'll have to give
it a try. Maybe it won't be quite like the simulator.

Okay.
CAP COM
Okay. You faded out the very
beginning so please go through that again. We understand
you don't get anything on MAIN B.

Okay Vance. How are you reading now?
CAP COM
Okay. We're hearing you better.
Stand by one.
CAPCOM
Okay Jack. Please repeat back now
your conversation. You were cut out awhile ago.
SC
I don't have any idea where we cut
out, Vance. I just said that we performed the procedures
exactly as you say. We're down into the step critical portion
to where I said select best OMNI. However, we're
not getting any main bus B voltage reading. I can read batt
bus B Baker and 36.5 batt Charley and 37.0 but I have
negative Main Bus B reading.

we wish he'd use the backout procedure and shutdown again.
Per the procedure we gave him.
SC
Roger. As soon as he gets his onboard readout
to use the powered down procedure and shutdown. Is that
right?

AQUARIUS Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM Roger, go ahead.
AQUARIUS I just want to go over a little philosophy here.
Fred told me that at one time you came up and told him that
we were a little steep on the entry angle and now our burn
is going to make it, give us a steeper angle. I just want
to make sure that we're all talking about the same thing,
and in this particular situation we're shallow. And we are
going to increase the angle.
CAP COM Jim. The situation is that at the
moment we're a little bit shallow and retro grade mid course
is going to put us more on the center of the corridor, over.
AQUARIUS Okay, fine. I just wanted to make
sure. Fred had written down, some time ago, that our angle
now was about 71 and we were going to do a mid course of 7 feet
per second (garble)
CAP COM Rog. And I guess it follows, but your
perigee is a little bit high right now too, SO that will
be bringing it back, back down that is.
AQUARIUS (garbled)
CAP COM One other question, Jim. Our readings
down here say your LM cabin is about as cold as the command
module cabin. Is that right?
AQUARIUS Well, we really don't know. There's
two people in the LM cabin and it seems to be a lot more
compact so we don't notice the coldness down here as we do in
the command module.
CAP COM
Okay.

And an additional point, I guess
this ones for Jack. Do you have any idea why we couldn't
read the MAIN BUS B voltage awhile back when first he didn't
get it and then later he did?
SC
Yeah. I think we have a reading of
that. Stand by.

It appears Vance that the battery
charge circuit breaker which appeared to be in wasn't
in. Fred pulled it and reset it and then he started
getting readings.

It was - it was the battery charge
circuit breaker that allows you to read volts. I don't know

CAP COM
Read you loud and clear, Fred. How do you
read us?
SC
Okay, (garble).
CAP COM
Roger, we were just about to send you up some
items of information pertaining to the burn. Are you ready
to copy?
SC
Standby.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, go ahead, Vance.
CAP COM
Okay, Fred. First of all, preparations for
this starting with contingency checklist, page 24; we would
recommend should start at 104:30 GET, and we'll be happy to
receive any comments you have on that, though. The second
point - when you're in the burn attitude you should see the
Sun at the very top of the AOT; it'll be splitting the curser
when you're curser's set at zero. One thing to be aware of,
though, that it'll slip right out of the AOT very easily since
it'll be very sensitive to roll and yaw. And that's in detent
two, by the way. Next point, the burn is very insensitive
to burn time, and attitude; in other words, if necessary we
can slip it if there's any problem at all, and attitude isn't
too critical. So that brings us to the point, that we only
have one real burn rule, that is if rate right on the axis
get to 10 degrees a second, that's the limit to stop the
burn. Next point, after you finish the burn, and before you
trim; request that you leave DEDA address 470 up a while SO
we can take a look at it, and let us holler when we've seen
it, and then proceed on. Over.
SC
Okay, Vance. You're saying we should start
into the prep in the contingency book at about 104:30, and
I'll talk it over in a minute with Jim, and we'll get back
with you on it. When in the burn attitude, we should see
the Sun right at the top of the AOT And I assume this is descent
number 2. Jim and I'd already been talking about that and -
eye balling the terminator in the Earth, we figured the Sun
at about something like a 70 degree angle 65 degree angle
so it ought to be right up there. We got one burn rule, and
it says that if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per
second, shut her down. And, after we trim, you want me to
leave 470 up for awhile so y'all can have a look at it, and
you'll tell me when to get rid of it.
CAP COM That's right, Fred. And, if you have any
questions at all, regarding the alignment; why please let us
know. We'll be happy to answer them, like aligning on the
Earth, as was described before. Also, you should know that
the pitch is the most critical attitude SO far as errors are
concerned, in this burn, but, as I said, it's still not very
sensitive.
SC
Yes, the and unfortunately the way we're

--- PAGE 626 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-15-70 CST 8:52P GET 103:39 443/2
SC
- looking out the window, through the COAS,
we can align the yaw and roll pretty well, but it's the -
Sun that has to get us pitch.
CAP COM Right, and - and a correction on this DEDA
470 thing. Request that we let you - give you a go before
you trim. Over.
SC
Say - say again, Vance, on that last.
CAP COM Roger. We would like to see address 470,
and give you a go before you trim. Over.
SC
Oh, okay. I - I see. Okay, after burn, we'll
leave 470 up awhile and wait for your word to do the trim.
CAP COM That's correct. How was the sleep?

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-15-70 CST 9:01P GET 103:48:00 444/1
CAP COM
How was the sleep?
SC
Okay. And okay, Vance, are you
there?
CAPCOM
Roger. Go ahead.
SC
Okay. The picture that Jim gave
me on his view through the COAS was within partial earth, the
lit portion laid in the top half of the COAS with the
cusp laying right on the Y - Y line. And so the the whole
dark part of the earth would be at the bottom part of the
earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line
above the yy line.
CAP COM Okay. That is correct.
SC
That in essence that in essence
would put our X axis pointing toward the sun.
CAP COM That's correct. The plus X axis
pointing toward to sun and perpendicular to the terminator
of the earth.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Two other points, Fred. One is that
we don't expect hardly any misalinement of your engine for
the burn, SO we don't really expect any rates throughout the
length of the burn, especially since it's very low thrust.
Second point, request you verify that your suit temperature
rheostats in full cold. If it were in full cold, that might
help your cabin temperature situation. It might bring the
temperature up.
SC
Okay. Okay. The latter was a good
point. We had it in full hot.
CAP COM Very good.
SC
And roger on the roger on the rates
too.
CAPCOM
Okay.
SC
Okay, Vance. The TIG time going to
be approximately is it 105 or 105:30?
CAP COM
It's 105:30.
SC
Okay. Your 104:30 time to start in. It
sounds pretty good. That will give us lots of time
to get set up with the attitude business, in case, if we have
any trouble, stopping PTC and getting there and that will give
us a little time to be setting and waiting all set up.
CAP COM
Okay, Fred. Good.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Over.

Velocity is 4,399 feet per second. We are an hour and 18
minutes away from the nominal midcourse burn time. As you
heard Vance Brand tell the crew, this burn is insensitive
or relatively insensitive at least to time and, if for some
reason the crew is busy and can't make it at that time, they
could at their option slip this burn as much as 30 minutes.
However, at the present time we expect it will be done very
close to the nominal time of 105 hours, 30 minutes. Approxi-
mately 30 minutes later at 106 hours we still expect the
first disc on the supercritical helium tank of the LM descent
stage to go and vent that helium tank overboard. We'll

Okay. We're pressing in to getting
PTC established right now.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 105 hours
23 minutes. That trimming was done with the reaction control
system. The burn looked good. Fido will want to get some
tracking now and look at that for awhile before he can tell
precisely what was achieved. Decision has been made to go
ahead and reestablish passive thermal control prior to the
super critical helium tank venting. There's enough uncertainty
into the time when that will vent now that we're going to
go ahead and establish the PTC. We can expect venting
anytime up to and within the next 2 hours probably. We'll
continue to standby for live air to ground transmission.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to
change the number of yaw pulses we gave you before as 21.
We'd like to reduce that to 12. 12 pulses yaw right and
that'll take you about 3 seconds to get them in if you don't
want to count them.

This is Apollo Control at 106 hours
2 minutes. We're in the midst of a shift change over here
in Mission Control at this time. Flight Director, Milton
Windler and the Maroon Team of Flight Controllers are
replacing Flight Director, Jerry Griffin and the Gold Team.
Our Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut,
Jack Lousma. One of our large LM status boards here in
Mission Control would indicate that the power down in the
LM is completed at this time. During the burn, the power
levels off the LM were running around 25 amps. We're now
showing the power somewhere between 10 and 12 amps. The
target level during the power down is to keep it to at least
14 amps, so we're well below the minimum target, and in very
good shape on LM power at this time. Flight Director Windler
at this time is reviewing the status from each of his Flight
Controllers, and at the present time Apollo 13 is 150 302
nautical miles from Earth. Travelling at a velocity of
4 498 feet per second. There will be a change of shift
briefing. We do not have a time at the moment. We'll pass
that along to you as soon as it is available. At 106 hours

P AO
This is Apollo Control. Flight director
Milton Windler has completed checking the status with each
of his flight controllers at this time, and the general tenor
all the way around was that we're in very good shape at the present
time. A couple of the significant items discussed, the surgeon
reported that the lithium hydroxide, the makeshift lithium
hydroxide canaster appears to be doing an excellant job. We're
presently reading a carbon dioxide level of 1.2 millimeters of
mercury. The LM telcom, reported that they're beginning to
see the effects of the engine burn heat soak back into the
helium tank and related rise in pressure in the helium, which
would indicate that the burst disk may go a bit earlier than
originally predicted, although the heat soak back had been
expected. The plot that we have on the pressure rise in the
helium tank would indicate the burst disk going sometime between
107 and 108 hours, ground elapse time. The range on the burst
disk is 1881 pounds per square inch to 1970 pounds per square
inch and somewhere between this pressure range we would expect
the burst disk to go relieving the pressure on the super-critical
helium tank. The flight dynamics officer reported that when
we get the burst disk rupture, they will be observing what they
call Doppler shift, to see what effect the venting from the helium
tank has on the trajectory. If there is no effect on the trajectory,
we would expect to have a preliminary data on the effects of the
midcourse correction within about 2 hours. That would be about
2 hours after the burst disk ruptures. If on the other hand,
there is some change in velocity as a result of the burst disk
rupture, the flight dynamics officer said that it would be at

--- PAGE 645 ---

PAO
least 5 hours before we had a preliminary
estimate on the trajectory, the new trajectory. We've noted that
the communications has gotten somewhat noisier. This is related
to the power down of the lunar module. One of the items that
is turned off in the power down is the communications power
amplifier. This increases the noise with respect to the signal
and we do expect the communications to remain more or less
noisier than they have been. This condition will vary as
the spacecraft attitude changes and as the position of the
antennas changes with respect to the tracking antennas on earth.
The flight plan at this time calls for the command module pilot
Jack Swigert and the lunar module pilot Fred Haise to get about
6 hours of rest. Jim Lovell will stay on the watch in the lunar
module. At 106 hours, 16 minutes, Apollo 13 is 149 706 nautical
miles from earth, traveling at speed of 4509 feet per second.
And the clock in Mission Control counting down to entry shows
that we have 36 hours, 24 minutes until earth entry. This is
Apollo Control at 106 hours, 17 minutes.

I read you loud and clear, Jack.
CAPCOM Okay, Jack. What's your status, who's
sleeping and who's working?
SC
Well, right now we're all three kind of
working. Do you have any recommendations?
CAP COM Yeah. Looks like to us from here that you
and Fred ought to get some sleep, and that you ought to eat
in about 6 hours. And that the Skipper ought to go to bed
about 113 hours.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM I've got some other information. We should
have some good dope on your trajectory in about 2 hours.
Looked like to us that the burn was real good, however, and
we're taking a close look at it and we'll get back with you
on that in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that we're
expecting to have happen is that the S CH tank is going
to reach it's burst limit. The earliest time we predict
this will happen will be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes.
And the latest probably time is at 110 hours, and this is
suppose to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you might hear it
and you might see something.
SC
Okay. That's good news. We were wondering
about that. And I'll relay all the other information you
gave me.
CAP COM Okay. And if the SCH tank does burst during
this time frame before we get trajectory info why that will
delay our trajectory info somewhat. Your consumables, your
water is now good through 150 hours.

Jack, wait a minute. Let me copy some of
this down.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay. I'm ready now.
CAP COM Okay. We're predicting that you still have
more water than you need. And one thing we'd like you to
do is when you're going to sleep up there in the command
module take a look through the optics and see if you can
see any stars.
SC
Okay, Jack. I will do. Jim and I were
able to spot constellations from the windows of the LM
when there's no venting taking place. Could you give me
some time on these consumables that you predicted once more?
I think you started to give times. I didn't hear or was I
just hearing things?
CAP COM We started to give you some times. We
think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty
soon. But it looks like your water is good through 154 hours,

time to start venting again so I probably won't be able to
get a good hack out of stars out of the telescope.

While we're waiting for the information
which Jack Swigert requested on the expected lifetime of the
two current lithium hydroxide canisters, we might recap some
of the conservation between Swigert and Capcom Jack Lousma.
Jack Swigert reported the crew had taken no medication and
he said as far as rest they're no more tired than normally
in this situation. He said they planned to switch to a rest
cycle as indicated in the flight plan as soon as it's conven-
ient. Now we passed up a consumable status to the crew.
Also the status on the super critical helium tank burst disk
we expect will be within the range where the disk could
rupture within a matter of minutes. We're presently showing
the super critical helium tank pressure at 1874 pounds per
square inch. We'll hit the lower limit of 1881 pounds per
square inch shortly and we'll be advising the crew when that
level is reached. Jack Lousma advised them that they likely
will hear the disk rupture and may see something from the LM
at the time it ruptures.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. In regards to the
C02 canisters, by the way the PC02 is reading 1.6 down here
now. We expect that we can get six more hours out of the
two canisters that we have there. Six hours at least.
However, at 112 hours, when we've got several people up,
we're going to rig up two more and we have the new simplified
procedure for doing this. However, in the meantime, should
we need to have a canister change, we plan to switch to the
LM primary canister. Over.
SC
Okay. Copy that, Jack.
CAP COM
And Aquarius, how's your PTC holding
up?
SC
Well, we got a little bit off Jack.
The it starts high in the LMP window and goes low in the
CDR window. So we've got a little bit of a wobble on it.
Of course, the command module venting doesn't help either.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.

Jack, in reference to your question
about the PTC, on this last complete revolution, the sun
first appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP

the overhead window and now the moon is it's pretty
well through the center of both windows this last time.

CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to get a little
better idea of how PTC is going. So what we'd like for you
to do is what we did last time. And that is to give us a
reading on the center of the Earth and the center of the
Moon on the LPD.
SC
On the LPD. Okay. It's shifted. Let's
see, the Moon's gone by and the Earth didn't come into the
LPD last night.
CAPCOM Okay. But when it goes by the plane of the
LPD tell us where it was. Okay?
SC
Okay. Will do.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 107 hours 11 minutes.
Our displays based on telemetry information from the space-
craft currently show that we have pressure in the super
critical helium tank of about 1889 pounds per square inch.
This is within the range where the burst disk on the tank
could rupture. The range is roughly between 1881 pounds
per square inch and 1970 pounds per square inch. During
the last 10 or 15 minutes there's been a huddle around the
flight directors console. The subject of the discussion is
what procedure we use if the burst disk does not rupture as
expected. The pressure in the tank should not go above
about 2000 pounds per square inch. If the burst disk does
not rupture, we would need to use an alternative method of
depressurizing the tank. These alternatives involve either
depressurizing by venting all at once or by venting in stages,
a little at a time. And a decision has not been made at this
time on how the tank will be vented in the event it is
necessary. But those are the options that we have as it
appears right now. You've also heard Jack Swigart aboard
the LM reporting the relative position of the Earth and the
Moon and the Sun as the spacecraft rotates in the passive
thermal control mode. As these bodies come into view through
the windows, we've asked him to give a relative position of
the Earth and Moon on the landing point designated, the
grid on the LM window which is calibrated and will give us
a bit more precise information on how the spacecraft is
maintaining it's passive thermal control attitude. At the
present time now we show Apollo 13 to be 147 186 nautical
miles from the Earth.
SC
I just passed the Earth. It came into view
at the top left hand corner of the LMP window and was going
down. However, when it passed it wasn't as high up as the
last pass. It did pass into view at the CDR window but too
high up to get an LPD reading.
CAPCOM Roger. Understand it went high in both
windows then.
SC
Yeah. Last time it wasn't even in view
in the CDR window this time it was visible but too high to
get an LPD reading.

This is Apollo Control at 107 hours
31 minutes. We're presently reading a pressure on the super
critical helium tank of 1897 pounds per square inch. Our
LM control officer just advised the flight director that
he expects the most likely time for the burst disk on the
super critical helium tank to rupture would be within the
next 15 minutes or SO. At that time our indication in
Mission Control that the disk has ruptured would be a drop
in the tank pressure to zero. We presently show a current
on the spacecraft electrical power system of anywhere from
10 to 12 amps. This is well below the minimum that we'd
like to stay under. We'd like to keep it down to at least
14 amps and since the spacecraft is then powered down, we've
been well below that figure.

the fact that Lovell is now on watch might indicate that
Jack Swigert and Fred Haise are planning to get a rest period.
In mission control, flight director Milt Windler has been
discussing the situation with the super critical helium
tank and what options we've got if the burst disk does not
rupture as it is expected it will. And as we've mentioned
before, at that time it appeared the options were either
to vent the super crit vent the pressure from the super critical
helium tank at a series of small vents or to vent it all at
once. After looking at the situation, it's been decided
that the procedure, should it be necessary to relieve the
pressure by venting would be to vent it all at once. In
this event it is felt that the fuel in the fuel heat exchanger
would be frozen and we would not be able to thaw it out
again. This would render the descent propulsion system
unusable for further maneuvers, however, we have adequate
consumables in the LM ascent stage, adequate propulsion in
the ascent stage. It's also felt that if a subsequent mid-
course was needed probably closer into the Earth entry, we
would be able to perform this midcourse using the ascent
propulsion stage of the lunar module. The present pressure
on the super critical helium tank as read from telemetry
data here in mission control is 1913 pounds per square inch.
The rise rate has slowed down somewhat. Recapping again
the predicted range for the burst disk rupture is between
1881 pounds per square inch and 1970 pounds per square inch.
We wouldn't begin to get concerned about the pressures on
the super critical helium tank until it got up around
2000 pounds per square inch. And the LM control officer
anticipates that we would not get up around the 2000 pounds
per square inch in the event the burst disk does not rupture
until about 114 or 115 hours ground elapsed time. Experience
we've had with ground tests on the super critical helium burst
disk indicates that it should be rupturing around the pressure
we've got now in the low 1900's. And we're continuing to
watch that. The LM power is continuing to run as it has since
power down between 10 and 12 amps, and we look very good
in that respect. There's also been no change in the status

of any of the other consumables aboard the
spacecraft. They all continue to look quite good at this
time. Apollo 13 is presently 144 958 nautical miles from
the Earth, traveling at a speed now 4613 feet per second.
We're now 34 hours 37 minutes until Earth entry. At 108 hours
4 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.

That's right.

On the basis of the data we had so far
your entry angle is 5.99. The block data we gave you on a pad
for a no-Comm midcourse 7 last night is no longer valid because
we made this midcourse.
SC
Okay. Understand, the no-Comm pad is no
longer valid because of the midcourse. Entry-angle based on
the last 2-hour tracking is 5.99, and I take it you're going to
keep tracking for some time now to see if we'll need another
midcourse or not.
CAP COM That's affirmative.

Are you planning any no-Comm midcourse
at 134 and change anyway right now, or are you going to wait?
CAP COM We're discussing that now Jim and it looks
like we're going to wait on the tracking. For the time being,
since you're in the corridor, why there's no need to pass it up,
but we're going to keep looking into tracking and we'll probably
come up with one.
SC
All right. I'm not too sure what the venting
is going to do to us so, when this SCHE tank ruptures, what it's
going to do for us.
CAP COM Roger. We don't presently expect the SCHE
tank to have any effect in your trajectory, and the pressure is
up to 1921 now.

This is Apollo Control at 108 hours 52 min-
utes. The flight dynamics officer hopes to have a preliminary
set of numbers on the effects of the midcourse correction.
At about 109 hours 30 minutes or a little over 37 minutes
from now, the burn was targeted to give the spacecraft a
flight path angle of minus 6.52 degrees at entry interface.
Now we won't have a confirmation of this, of course, until
the flight dynamics officer is able to complete the tracking
and compilation of data to come up with some preliminary
numbers. But the targeted value of that course was to give
us a flight path angle of minus 6.52 degrees. The entry
corridor which is the width of the flight path angle that
we feel we can withstand is about minus 5.25 degrees to
about minus 7.4 degrees of flight path angle. We're still
watching the super critical helium pressure aboard the LM
descent stage increase gradually. The pressure is now
reading 1937 pounds per square inch. I would like to cover
again the procedures which we mentioned have been worked out
in the event that the burst disk did not rupture as it is
expected to do. The burst disk, of course, is in there to
relieve pressure on the tank, on the super critical helium
tank when the pressure gets above a certain specified limits.
The disk is designed to rupture at between 1881 pounds per
square inch and 1970 pounds per square inch. In the event
the disk does not rupture, Flight Director Milton Windler
as flight controller has worked out a procedure that will
be followed to relieve the pressure on the tank, and we see
the pressure dropping at this time. The Control Officer
reports that the burst disk has ruptured. We just as we
were making this announcement -

you say it yawed some?

Yeah. I was in a right YAW and now I'm in

Sure did, Jack. It reversed my YAW completely

SC
More than anything it reversed my YAW.
CAP COM Roger. Have you effectively established
PTC in the opposite direction then?

that the problem was a sensor problem rather than a problem
with the battery itself.

Okay Jim, since the antenna switch is kind
of annoying we've talked them into buying only half of the data
if it gets too troublesome for you to switch antennas, why
just leave it on one antenna and we'll listen to you half of
the time.
SC
Okay. It's not very much trouble
that's all we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with
it. And you're satisfied with this strategy so far, huh. I
guess you're going to watch the thermal and find out whether
we're going to have to go to some other PTC attitude.
CAP COM Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem.
We're looking at what DELTA V might have been imparted due to
this, and it looks like we're not going to change the PTC
attitude.
SC
Okay. Then DELTA V was a part
of helping to raise that angle a little bit.
CAPCOM Yes. We'll be looking at the data here
and give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or SO.
SC
Okay. Meanwhile, back to the drawing
board about the no-pro vent.
CAP COM And with your kind of luck it probably
lowered the angle some more.
SC
Thanks for the confidence.
CAP COM And Jim, we're going to have a handover
here pretty soon, but in 3 minutes we may lose up-blank for
30 seconds or a minute.
SC
Okay.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 109 hours,
27 minutes. Capcom, Jack Lousma, was advising Jim Lovell that
we'll be handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone,
California to the Honeysuckle, Austrailia site in about 3 minutes.
During this handover, for a period of about 30 seconds to a
minute we will not be able to up-link to the spacecraft. At
about 109 hours, 13 minutes the crew reported a master alarm
and a battery light flickering. We had them turn up the, turn
on the power amplifier and give us high bit-rate datas so that
we could look at the batteries here on the ground. After a look
at them they telemetered the LM electrical systems engineer in
Mission Control. He said that he was confident the problem
was the same one that we'd seen yesterday, in which we probably
have a sensor problem rather than a problem with the battery
itself, and the sensor is triggering the alarm. The crew
is advised to put the battery back on line and leave it there.
The super critical helium Burst-Disk ruptured at about 108 hours,
54 minutes, 40 seconds after reaching a pressure of 1937 pounds
per square inch. Lovell reported at the time seeing particles
coming off, and also the pressure of the escaping gas, which
was thought ahead of time to be a was predicted to be a

non-propulsive vent, turned out to be a
very much a propulsive vent. Lovell said that the spacecraft
stack which had been rotating about its longitudinal axis
at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour. This rotational
rate was stopped by the vent and started up again in the
opposite direction, and it is now rotating about one revolution
every 2 minutes. One revolution a little less than every
2 minutes, as compared with a revolution every 18 or 19 minutes
in the opposite direction prior to the vent. So, that was
very much a propulsive vent. Hence, the remarks from Lovell,
back to the drawing board on non-propulsive vent. The crew
asked if there was any problem with the rotational rate they
had as far as the structure of the vehicle and the temperatures
on board. After a review of this situation in the span engineering
room it was reported that there would be no problem, either with
vehicle temperatures or structure, leaving this rotational
rate as it is, and we advised the crew to let it continue to
rotate at that rate, and the only problem might be in switching
from one antenna to the other. Now, this of course, is function -
SC
Houston, we're handed over. How do you read?
S C
Bringing on a crew Jack.
CAPCOM
(Garbled) hear you now and (Garbled)
SC
How do you read now?
CAP COM
Okay, that's a lot better, and we figure
you're battery glitch was just that thermal switch triggered
a mal - a caution and warning just cycled once and triggered
a master alarm again. We'll watch the batteries for you, since
you don't have any caution warning on them now.
SC
Okay, appreciate that.
PAO
This is Mission Control. As we were
saying, the only problem we, potential problem that we could
see with the rapid rotation rate or the more rapid rotation
rate of one revolution every 2 minutes might be that the
crew would have to switch from one antenna to the next and
it was felt that this might be troublesome, however, Lovell
reported that it would be no problem and they would attempt
to keep up with it. In the event that they miss an antenna switch
we would lose data for perhaps 1 minute while the spacecraft
rotated around in a position for the other antenna to be
received on the ground. At the present time Apollo 13 is
140 934 nautical miles from the earth. Our velocity is up
now to 4700 feet per second. The very gradual velocity buildup
we've been seeing since crossing the sphere of influence line,
the imaginary line in which the earth's gravitational force
becomes the dominant gravity force acting on the spacecraft,
and we begin to see at that point a gradual acceleration due
to earth's gravity.

This is Apollo Control at 110 hours
8 minutes. We estimate that the amount of velocity change
imparted to the combined stack of vehicles by the disk rupture
and the super critical helium tank was about 2/10 of a foot
per second. This amount of velocity DELTA V addition to the
spacecraft was able to stop the rotational rates in one
direction and start them up in another. The rotational rate
had been about 1 revolution every 18 19 minutes.

good up to 161 hours now.
SC
Hey, that sounds great.

Jack Lousma just advised Jim Lovell
that current estimates of water would indicate that he's got -
the crew has sufficient water on the LM for 161 hours.
CAP COM
- - for command module water.
SC
Very good. Jack, I'd just like to
know what plans are being contemplated for the
PLSS's or the OPS, whether we're going to use our LiOH
canisters or take the devices back in the command module
with us or just what will be your plans.
CAP COM Yes. We're talking all that over
now. We haven't decided.
SC
Okay.
PAO
Jack Lousma was advising Lovell that
we have as I said before, about 161 hours of water on the
LM ascent/descent stage based on current consumption rates
and this does not include water in which we have available
in the command and service module or in the portable life
support systems, which would extend that margin somewhat
beyond the 161 hours.
PAO
And for some 45 minutes or so a
fairly sizable group - about a dozen people or so, have been
gathered around the flight director's console, discussing
the procedures to be followed during reentry. Lovell just
asked Jack Lousma what their procedure was being planned
for the oxygen purge systems, the emergency oxygen supply
carried with the backpack and lithium hydroxide canisters
available. On these, Lousma told him that we haven't reached
a conclusion on that. The meeting going on around the flight
director's console at this time, is involved with that sort
of thing. As well as what procedures to be followed as far
as jettisoning the LM and service modules all of these things
being considered and discussed. At the present time Apollo 13
is 139 164 nautical miles from the earth travelling at a
speed of 4745 feet per second. Also like to clarify again
the situation with respect to the super critical helium tank
and the burst disk which ruptured at about 180 hours when
the pressure got up to some 1937 pounds per square inch. This
burst disk is in the tank for the express purpose of keeping

--- PAGE 670 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 3:19A GET 110:06:00 474/2
PAO
pressure from going above levels which
the tank can withstand. Had the disk failed to rupture,
we had a backup procedure worked out whereby the tank would
be vented manually. Of course, it was not necessary to
put this backup into effect because the disk ruptured at
about the level it was expected it would. With the burst
disk rupturing, what we have effectively lost is the ability
to resupply a pressure to the tanks as this pressure is
drained off by burning the descent propulsion system engine.
However, we do have what is called blow down capability
in the engine. That's the pressurization that already exists
and which is not lost by depressurizing the super critical
helium tank. This - the pressure that is in the propellant
tanks remains there, is isolated from the super critical
helium tank and is not lost when the first disk ruptures.
With this pressurization we still have some 800 feet per
second of DELTA V remaining and usable in the descent propul-
sion system engine.
CAP COM Everything's running real smooth
over in Timber Cove, Jim.

Sounds pretty good. How about in
E1 Lago?

CAP COM Jim, we've had a lot of people working on
the entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to do SO.
We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at you so you can
start thinking about them if you think you're in a posi-
tion to discuss them without waking up the other guys.
What do you think?
SC
Yes, go ahead. It's okay.
CAP COM Okay. One of the first things we want to
do is charge the battery in CSM so we can get some LM power
over there to do that, and we have procedures gined up to
do it. In regards to reentry, we're planning our last
midcourse at 5 hours before entry interface, if we have to
make one that is. We'd like to jettison the service module
at 4 hours and a half roughly before entry interface and
take the next 3 to 3 and a half hours for taking pictures
bringing up the lunar module G&N, taking care of stowage,
and other odds and ends. And we'll hang on to the LM until
1 hour before entry interface, then we'll jettison that.
These procedures are going to be run integrated in the CMS
and LMS tomorrow morning, and hopefully later on in the day
we'll do it again with Mission Control on the loop. A
couple of other things we'd like to toss at you. One question
is what do we do with the OPS. The thought is that there is
adequate 02 in the command module. And that the OPS represents
high pressure source and stowage problem, and people are thinking
about leaving them in the LM. The other thing is that we
think you might want to make this a suited entry, suiting
up prior to LM jettison, because what we're doing is
when we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like we
did in Apollo 10. Just let the beauty go and if we weren't
suited , betting on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we
thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some of them are ones
that are particularly impertent questions at this time.

of those verbal details ought to be taken care of before a
mid-course.
SC
And again as a last resort (garbled) that mid-
course fairly early, if we have the power to do SO. Mainly
becaue of attitude control, this last part is fairly easy, and I'm
not too sure how long to configure (garbled). I have the
confidence that if everything is under control as it is now,
we'll probably be going long before entry.
CAP COM Yes, that is what we were thinking.
I guess the 2 things that are somewhat unresolved are what
to do with the OPS and what to do about the suited entry.
We thought we'd pass those at you to see what you thought
about them.
SC
Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned,
we have enough oxygen (garbled) to get us through (garbled)
Command Module (garbled) prior to entry (garbled).
CAP COM Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching
what you're saying. The Comm is getting kind of bad right
now.
SC
Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
CAP COM I've still got you with quite a bit
of background noise, but if you talk up, I think we can hear
you.
SC
Okay. My only concern about leaving
the OPS and/or the PLSS in the Command Module (garbled)
Command Module consumables prior to entry and the PLSS,
and has (garbled).
CAP COM It sounds like the general jist of your
comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are
now in the Command Module, you'd just as soon leave the
OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?
SC
That's affirm.
CAP COM
Okay, and maybe you'd like to think
over the suited entry bit a little while.
SC
Okay.

SC
(garbled) how we can aline the Command
Module guidance for entry, especially if you have a (garbled
DAP. Over.
CAP COM Roger. That's one subject that's
been getting a lot of attention, and let me see if I can
get some general ideas on that at the moment.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Jim, I can give you the general idea.
The proposed procedure for bringing the Command Module G
and N up. It's the presently proposed one. We may come
up with a better one, but here's what we're looking at
right now. First thing we plan to do is to use the LM
COAS - site on the Earth with the LM just as we did in the
mid-course. Then we'll do a body acc -

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 3:49A GET 110:36:00 477/1
CAPCOM - earth with the LM just as we did in
the midcourse. Then we'll do a body axis align 400 plus 5
on the EGA, to put the EGS ball at 000. And, then we can give
you an EGS ball attitude to fly to, to point the CSM optics
at the moon, and if you can see stars, why we can use those
too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of CDU angles
to put into noun 20 and to torque the platform over. So,
now we're course aligned. Then we do a fine align by shooting
at the moon and then at the sun. Do you follow all that?
SC
Okay Jack, let me see if I have it.
What we do is point the LM at the earth as we did for the
midcourse (Garbled) Then we do a body axis align on the EGS.
Then you give us an EGS ball attitude to fly to. Do this with
the LM, then we (garbled) point the CSM EGS at the moon. Then
you give us the update give us some lines to use to coarse
align and the fine align using stars, or moon or earth.
Stand by. Okay, we had another master alarm Jack. I don't see
the lights on there except the battery lights still there. We
put an EGS displace (garbled) Okay, number 2 battery still has
a light on it. I expect it is the same problem that we had
before. (Garbled)
CAPCOM Okay, let us talk it over a second and
we'll tell you what to do.
CAP COM Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?
SC
Yes. That's affirm Jack. Yes, the
battery light's flickering and it triggered off the master
alarm.
CAPCOM Okay. Well, that - temperature sets
are on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and
everytime it does it triggers a master alarm Jim.
SC
Okay, same old problem huh?
CAP COM Yes.
CAP COM And Jim, finally on the P52 we're
considering using the moon and then the sun for the fine align.
SC
Okay, The moon and the sun for the fine
align. Understand. We'll go through this again here.
SC
Okay Jack, on ce I get the spacecraft at the
proper attitude (garbled)
CAP COM Jim I didn't copy your last question due
to background noise.
SC
Okay. Once you get the EGS ball aligned (Garbled)
(Garbled) command module.
CAP COM After we do the body axis align on the
EGS we can tell you what attitude on the EGS ball to fly to
in order to point the CSM optics at the moon or at some star,
and then we can, according to where the optics are pointed,
give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in noun 20
to torque to platform.
SC
Okay, okay.
CAP COM That's the current thinking. It may
change between now and tomorrow, but right now that's the way

Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or
another system, GNS (Garbled) or something like that.

CAP COM Jim, are you broken into the food
locker in the LM yet?
SC
That's affirm, Jack. I sure have.
I just put a meal away.
CAP COM You say you did find everything in
order in there?
SC
Yes, everything is straight.
CAP COM
Okay. I'll pass it.
CAP COM
I had a question about that earlier.
SC
Right.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead.
SC
I understand that one of your reasons
for a suited entry is the fact that the command module
hatch (garbled) is still acting good. Out hatch doesn't
seem to be any different than any other (garbled) other
spaceships.
CAP COM No. The situation, Jim, is that your
hatch is as good as any other hatch, but that we won't have
a chance to verify it still so late in the game like 1 hour
before entry interface, in this case, whereas before, we
had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.
SC
Oh, okay.
CAPCOM
And that might make your timeline
a little too crowded, getting your suits on there at the
last minute, say less than an hour before entry interface.
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM Jim, the next action item we want to
persue is transferring some LM power up to the command module
main B so we can start charging battery and I guess what we
ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up
to help you. So when you decide to get the other guys up
or to have someone to help, why let us know and we'll start
working on that.
SC
Okay. I'll let you have Jack and
Fred (garbled) When are the timeline (garbled)
CAP COM
Say again, Jim. I didn't catch that.
SC
When in our timeline do (garbled) do you
plan (garbled)
CAP COM Jim, I didn't catch all of what you
said, but I think you wanted to know when the procedures
for entry are going to be available and read up to you. If
that's the case, why we're talking about 120 hours or SO.
As far as the charging battery A, we want to do that as
soon as the other guys get up to help you. We've already
passed up some of that procedure and we have a couple of
DELTA's to it.
SC
Roger. And Jack, (garbled)
CAP COM Jim, we're having trouble hearing
you. The next order of business is to charge battery A and
when you get somebody to help you there, why we'll go get

Okay, Jack.
CAPCOM
And before you start working on it,
let us know because we've got some DELTA's to be battery
charging procedure.
SC
Roger. I'm yelling back on the line now
(garbled)
SC
(garbled)
CAPCOM
Aquarius, did you call?
SC
Yes, Jack. I'm on the line (garbled)
CAPCOM
Okay. Go ahead now. I can hear
better.
SC
Okay, Jack. Joe Kerwin passed me
up the procedure for powering the CSM from the LM (garbled)
CAP COM Yes. If you'll get that out, I'll
read you the DELTA's.
SC
Okay. I've got it.
CAP COM Okay. The second step was in the LM
circuit breakers panel 11 16, ascent ECA control, close two
of them - cross that out. In the next line we had battery
applied normal feed on, cross out battery prime and put
battery 6 in there. In the next line was - -
SC
Jack (garbled) Jack, I have for step
3 I have bat 5 and bat 6 normal keyed on. Do you just want
bat 6?
CAP COM That's affirmative. Just bat 6, Jack.
And the next line, you had battery 1 and 3. Make that battery
1, 2, 3, and 4. Just add bats 2 and 4. All 4 descent bats.
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 678 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 4:09A GET 110:56 479/1
CAP COM - And the next line you had battery 1 and
3 make that battery 1, 2, 3 and 4. Just add bats 2 and 4,
all 4 descent bats. And then the next two lines about
waiting 30 minutes, cross that out. And the next line
about batteries 2 and 4 off reset, cross that out, too.
CAP COM And Jack the -
SC
Okay. Let me read -
CAP COM Go ahead.
SC
Let me read you all the steps as I've got
them and make sure we've got them right. Step 2
will now be BAT 6 (garbled) on. Step 3 bat 1, 2, 3, and 4
off reset.
CAP COM Okay. That part's alright, Jack. And we
had about 11 or 12 steps for the command module. They go
as is with no change. And we had another couple procedures
for the LM. Stand by one.
SC
Okay. Jack, let me read you the command
module procedures just to make sure that I have them right,
also.
CAP COM Okay. Go ahead with the command module
procedures.
SC
Okay. Connect LM and CSM umbilicals.
Step 2, panel 5 LM power 1 ac and 2 ac closed, circuit
breakers. Step 3, panel 5 (garbled) closed. Step 4, panel
(garbled) then there's step 5 main B batt B bus B closed.
Down 58 holding then switch to LM power to CSM. Step 7
main B bat bus B open. Panel 15 bat power entry and post
landing open. Verified main bus holding.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. CSM procedures okay, and then
we had to go back to the LM and do something. And the first
line is okay, cross out bat 5 and 6 off, delete that. And
delete the next line also, that says panel 1116 ascent
ECA control open. Then we had a couple of notes which
remain the same. Go ahead.
SC
Okay. I didn't get the dope but I'll read
you the steps as I have them now. One step bat 1, 2, 3,
and 4 (garbled) have batteries 1, 3, 4 and 6 on. Is that
affirmative.
CAP COM That's affirmative. So now we have bat 1,
2, 3, 4, and 6 on, and I got 2 notes. Number 1 is your
circuit breaker protection limites the current to 15 amps.
Number 2 note is now the umbilical between the LM and the
command module is hot. And the main bus voltage can be
monitored by selecting main B.
SC
Okay, Jack. Keep those circuit breaker
protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube, the
umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot. I can monitor
main B for a bus voltage.
CAP COM That's affirm, Jack.
SC
Okay, Jack. One question here. If we
transfer power like this, we're not going to cut it short

--- PAGE 679 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 4:09A GET 110:56 479/2
SC
on power remaining in the CSM. (garbled)
CAPCOM
Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.
SC
Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM
for powering the LM, we aren't going to cut it short on
LM power requirement to get us back in entry interface
are we.
CAP COM That's a negative, Jim. According to the
latest update, we've got ampere hours out to 203 hours.
SC
Stand by.
SC
Jack, one question from Jim is he wants to
know whether the procedure (garbled)
CAP COM Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim
want to know?
SC
Okay. He would like to know whether the
procedure has been tried and whether it has been found to be
okay. And there's no danger of shorting out any of our
batteries or anything we have on board the LM now.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been
tried out as such however the hardware paths through which
the current flows are the same ones as we used during trans-
lunar trajectory and there's not a problem which short a
descent battery. Over.
SC
Okay. I'll relay that to Jim.
CAP COM Jack, of course the reason for all of this
is that we see we're 20 amp hours short on one of the
entry batteries, and we've got to juice that up to get you
home with.
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM Okay. Now, what we owe you from here on
out is the actual battery A charge procedure and then a
procedure to turn this -

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 4:19A, GET 111:06:00, 480/1
CAP COM Okay, what we owe you from here on
out is the actual Battery A charge procedure, and then a
procedure to turn this all around again.
SC
Okay. Do you have it there, and how
long is the (garbled)
CAPCOM Okay, Jack, I have the procedure in
front of me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's SO
long is because we're starting from this basic configuration
which we gave you earlier. It concerns a charge on Battery
A, of course, which is our low one. So, when you're ready
to copy it, let me know.
SC
Okay. Let's go at it.
CAP COM
Okay. Are you ready to read copy
it?
SC
Go.
CAP COM Okay. On Panel 250, circuit breaker
Batt A, power entry/post landing CLOSE. On Panel 275,
circuit breaker inverter power 2, Main B - CLOSE. Next
several circuit breakers are on Panel 5, circuit breaker
Batt relay Bus, Batt A - CLOSE. Circuit breaker DPS

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 4:19A, GET 111:06:00,480/2
CAP COM How about reaching over there on your
right hand side and turning the biomed out. To see if we
can improve the comm a little bit.
SC
Okay. How do you read now?
CAP COM Okay. I'm reading you real good now,
and I want to verify that the Main Bus Tie that we switched
OFF was PAD ALPHA Charlie.

That's fine. Main Bus Tie BATT ALPHA
Charlie. (garbled).
CAP COM Okay, and in Panel 3. We've got a
switch for you. AC inverter 2 to Main B.
SC
Okay. AC inverter 2 to Main B.
CAP COM Okay, and switch inverter 2, AC Bus 2
to ON. Another switch AC Bus 2 Reset - to Reset, and center.
Switch Battery charge to ALPHA. Switch DC indicator select
Batt charger, and then what we want you to do is to report
the charger current and voltage to MSFN every 10 minutes
for the first half hour, and then on ce every 30 minutes
after that. And that'll be on our call, Jack. Read back
the switches that I just gave you.
SC
Okay, Jack. Panel 3 AC inverter 2,
Main B, AC inverter 2 , Bus 2 - ON. AC Bus 2 Reset to
Reset and center. Batt charger A, AC indicator select Batt
charger. Report in amps and volts to MSFN every 10 minutes
for the first 30 minutes, and then every 30 minutes on a
MSFN call.
CAP COM Okay. That's a good readback, Jack.
Now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround that you missed
which you will have.
SC
Okay, let me ask one question. About
how long do you think it'll take to charge these batteries?
CAP COM
It'll take you about 15 hours.
SC
Jack, about how many amperes of LM
power will this (garbled)
CAP COM
Standby, we'll get it for you -

How many, Jack? (garbled)
END OF TAPE

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 4:29A GET 111:16:00 481/1
CAPCOM Stand by. We'll get it for you.
SC
(garbled)
CAP COM Okay, Jack. That's going to take
120 amp hours out of the LM which is equivalent to 10 hours,
which will put us back to 193 hours and that's plenty.
SC
Okay. Let me relay that to Jim here.
SC
Okay, Jack. One question here. If
we have any problems sending up this LM power to the CSM,
is the quickest way to get out of it, return to the normal
configuration as it would be to just switch the LM power
to CSM to reset then off?
CAP COM
Stand by one.
SC
I would like to give one quick step
that gave Jim report some sort of problem for us to get out
of it quickly.
CAP COM Okay. Let us talk it over a few minutes
here.
SC
Okay. Real fine.
SC
And while you guys are talking it
over you might read back, have you got the procedure for reversing
this I'll copy that
SC
Okay, Jack, are you with me?
CAP COM Yes. We're still here, Jack.
We want to do is follow you through on this so we're going
to get high bit rate to do it. In answer to your question,
to undo this procedure quickly, in the event of a problem
develops, be sure that you don't touch the LM power switch
cause it's got a reset position. But the way to undo it
is go to the CSM and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers.
And they're some of the first ones we read to you. Open
LM power 1 main B and open LM power 2 main B. You copy that?
SC
Okay. Understand. If I want to get
out of this real quickly I have to open just 2 circuit
breakers in the CSM, that's on panel 5, LM power 1 main B,
LM power 2 main B.
CAP COM Okay. And before you go ahead with
those, let's establish the high bit rate and wait one on
that. And then as we go through the procedure we want you to
wait when you get power on main B SO we can take a look at
main B without any lobes on it before we start charging
batteries.
SC
Okay. I understand you want high bit
rates on the LM or CSM just before we start this.
CAP COM That will be high bit rate on the
LM and stand by for it.
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM Okay, Jack, before we go ahead with
this what we want to do is read you the reverse normal

CAP COM
reverse procedure.
SC
Okay. I'm ready to copy.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack, I got the start on how
you reverse this procedure. Ready to copy?
SC
Go ahead, Jack.
CAPCOM Okay. First you want to reverse the
battery charge procedure. To do that on panel 3, switch
battery charge off, ac inverter 2 off, panel 5 main bus tie
bat ALPHA CHARLIE on up, panel 250, circuit breaker
bat Alpha, power entry and post-landing open. Readback.
SC
Okay, Jack. On panel 3, battery
charger off, ac inverter 2 off, for panel 5 main bus ties
Alpha Charlie on, panel 250 CB bat A, power entry and post-
landing open.
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jack, and then
if you' 11 go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on
that list, just opposite - open them all up - stand by one.
CAPCCOM Okay, Jack. Go back to the battery
charge procedure I gave you. And in order to terminate
charge just you'll just have to write open and off next
to the circuit switch that I gave you. So on panel 250,
that circuit breaker you've already opened. On panel 275,
inverter power 2 main B open, panel 5 bat relay bus bat A
open, EPS sensor unit ac bus 2 open, EPS sensor signal ACQ
open, battery charger main B open, battery charger ac power
open, battery charger bat A charge open, inverter control
2 open, inverter control 3 open, you've already done the main
bus time, bat charge switch to ac 1. Over on panel 3, you
have already set the ac inverter 2 to off then inverter
2 ac bus 2 off, ac bus 2 reset to off

CAP COM reset to off. You have already put the
battery charger switch to off, and your DC indicator select
main B. Over.
SC
Okay Jack, do you want me to read it back
to you?
CAP COM No, if you've got something in the right-
hand column for all of those we don't have to do it. And now
one more thing I owe you is how to untransfer LM power to the
CSM, and I'll get that for you in a jiffy.
SC
Okay, I'll be standing by to copy it.
CAP COM
Okay. We have a last minute change to
that.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 111 hours,
30 minutes. The procedure being read up to the crew by Capcom
Jack Lousma, is for recharging one of the three entry batteries
on the command module, battery A which is down about 20 amp-hours.
A full load on the entry batteries is nominally about 40 amp-hours,
and we understand the other two batteries, B and C are essentially
fully charged. Battery A is down about 20 amp-hours and their
plan is to replace the energy in the command module battery A
with electrical energy from the lunar module. This procedure
will require about 15 hours of charging time, and will draw
a total of about 8 amps from the LM.
SC
(Garbled)
but I just want
you to figure up (Garbled) and show me when to power up and
(Garbled) Yes I think SO. (Garbled)
CAP COM Go ahead.
SC
Okay Jack. What thing I guess you probably
all have considered it, but what heavy things can we store down
there where the SRC normally goes to help increase our L/D?
CAP COM I understand the question is what kind of
heavy things can you store where the SRC goes.
SC
Yes. They go down under the LAT underneath
the computer and the heavier things you have down there increases
the L/D. We don't have and SRC SO I was just wondering what heavy
things - -
SC
We could probably put some cameras, television
cameras, things like that that normally pretty heavy down there in
that inner SRC - no we can't put them there (Garbled) put in them
in that container down there which would help decrease our L
over D. Anything else you can
think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even
have a throw away station SO we're down a little bit in L over D.
CAP COM Okay, let me pass that question along
and get somebody working on it.
CAP COM Souvenirs I guess.
SC
What souvenirs? All I've got is a Marine
Corps foxhole digging shovel.
CAP COM You've got all you need then buddy.
CAP COM Okay, ready to copy the power removal from

SC
I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.
CAP COM
Okay. This one assumes that all the descent
batteries are in line and ascent battery 6 is on normal feed,
as we said earlier. First thing you do is go in the CSM and
look on panel 5 circuit breaker. LM power 2 main B open.
LM power 1 main A open, circuit breaker APS sensor signal
main B open.

there because of the antenna problem. (Garbled)
SC
Okay. What I got, Jack, was the procedure
assumes that all these descent batteries are on and bat 6 is
on normal C. Now we're going into the LM and on panel 5 we
take LM (garbled) LM 4 2 BC open. And that's as far
as I got.
CAP COM Okay the second one is on panel 5 also.
Circuit breaker, LM power 1. Main A open, circuit breaker EPS
sensor signal, main B open. Okay, read those back with the
CSM and I'll give you some steps in the LM.
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay. CB LM 4 2 BF open, CB LM 41 main A open,
CB EPS sensor signal main B open. Stand by one.
SC
Jack, I don't think we ever closed CB LM
41 main A. We closed LM 42 BC and LM power BC. Both of
them on main B.
CAP COM
Yes, you're right. Both of them should be
main B.
SC
Okay. Copy that.
CAPCOM
Okay. Ready to copy the LM.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. On panel 16 circuit breaker APS bat B
ties, 2 open, and now you've got to listen real carefully
for high volts and low volts. Battery 1 high volts, to off
reset, battery 2 low volts to off reset and then on, battery 2
high volts to off reset and then on, battery 1 high volts on
and in the circuit breaker on panel 16 EPS. Bat B ties,
both of them closed. Read back.

SC
Okay, Jack. Just for curiosity sake, does
FIDO have any information to whether that helium -
that dump effected our trajectory at all.
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius, our tracking data shows that
since your helium dump our entry angle has not changed from
it's value of 6.24 and somebody calculated that if we had a
propulsive vent that helium could roughly at the maximum only in
part DELTA-V of a half a foot per second or less anyway.
But we're continuing to track and as soon as we get some
more info we'll pass it along.

Okay. That's swell, Jack. Thank you
CAP COM
Sure.

Hello, Fred. Go ahead.

Okay. I guess the only question I
have is in the first - the very first portion involving the
LM here. Where I have to turn on the only Batt 6, and then
turn off all the descent batteries. You still read me?
CAP COM Okay. I read you until after turn off
Batt 6 - correction turn ON only Batt 6.
SC
Okay. The question is the only one, one ascent
battery that sticks on the line immediately followed by turning off
4 descent batteries. Is that correct?
CAP COM That's affirmative, Fred. That question
has been banged around and we decided to go that way.

Let's see, we will be powering other bus (garbled)
CAP COM That's affirmative, and we're reading
a turn on llamps right now.

one of the sleep restraints out of the command module, zipped
up in it and then hooked the tie right in the top of the
zipper onto the LM upper hatch handle. So it kind of held
me there and then stripped it up in the tunnel upside down
with my face toward the hatch SO the sunlight didn't get in
my eyes and that worked pretty good.

This is Apollo Control at 112 hours
18 minutes. The crew at this point has successfully completed
the transfer of power from the LM onto the Command Module
Main Bus B, and from there into the Battery Charger which is
charging Battery A, one of the 3 entry batteries used for
entry and post landing electrical power aboard the Command
Module. The hope is to bring this battery from its current
level of 20 amperes up to about 40 amperes which would be
essentially a full charge on Battery A. The other two batteries,
Battery B and C already being at full charge. The charging
operation on Battery A is expected to required about 15 hours,
and it began at 112 hours, 12 minutes ground elapsed time.
You heard Fred Haise report that Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert
had gone into the Command Module to power up the Battery
Charger and check on the readings there. When they came back
down, Fred said they were rubbing their hands, and noted that
it was a bit chilly in the Command Module. At the present
time Apollo 13 is 133 158 nautical miles from Earth and the
spacecraft velocity is up now to 4 891 feet per second. We're
30 hours 20 minutes 50 seconds from reentry, and according to
the revised flight plan at 112 hours the three crewmen should
be getting something to eat and also you heard CAPCOM, Jack
Lousma advise Jim Lovell that it appears to be about time
for him to get a bit of rest. The crew rest cycle has been
left up to them. Our flight plan on one of the large displays
here in Mission Control has some suggeseyd times for sleep, but
the crew has generally been working out their own sleep schedules
as convienent for them, and following it, and we don't have
an extremely good idea of when they plan to in advance, but
only add to the fact when they report to us that they have
gotten some sleep. At 112 hours 21 minutes, this is Apollo
Control, Houston.
CAP COM Aquarius, could you get an amps and volts
readout from Odyssey please?
SC
Okay. Standby. CMP is dotting across
there. You'd be amazed at how proficient you get at transferring
to the tunnel after the first thousand passages.

Okay. Jack reports from upstairs that he
can see stars and constellations out of the optic with the
sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the portion of the LM
QUAD (garbled) right now.
CAP COM Okay. The part I got was that he can see
stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected
off the QUADS. That's all I got.
SC
The point being that at least in the present
orientation you have to kind of wait till the sun isn't
reflected off the LM.
CAPCOM Okay. What you're saying is that you're
going to have to wait till the there is no sun reflection on
the LM to see the stars. Is that right?
SC
Yes. That's for the present orientation, of
course - but later on if you stop the moving around (garbled)

Repeating a figure passed on a little while
ago, the flight dynamics officer reports that as a result of the
midcourse correction the flight path angle at entry is within
the entry corridor. The flight path angle currently appears to
be minus 6.24 degrees at entry interface. The nominal flight
path angle is 6.5 and that is what the midcourse correction
was targeted for. 6.24, a negative 6.24 degrees is within the
entry corridor and a descision has not been at this time as to
whether any subsequent midcourse corrections will be required.

the measurement is taken at the outlet and does not represent
the free air temperature in the cabin, which is probably up
around 70. As mentioned earlier, Apollo 13 gross weight of
both vehicles is now 87 740 pounds. Of this weight 58 728 pounds
are rocket propellant, about 29 tons. This computes out to
67 percent of the total vehicle weight in propellants. Apollo 13
is the fifth time that a manned spacecraft has made the return
from the moon. Apollo 8 back in December of 68 was a somewhat
conservative approach using the command and service module only,
and going into lunar orbit, having quite a large margin of
propellant available to go into lunar orbit and to make trans-
earth injection out of lunar orbit back toward earth. Apollo 10,
the all up spacecraft, went into lunar orbit, did everything
but the actual landing, including the descent orbit down to
about 8 miles above the moon, stopped short of making the descent
and here again there were adequate margins of propellant and
with Apollo 11 the landing was made. And Apollo 12 was essentially
a repeat as far as the amount of propellants and the spacecraft
performance were concerned. At any rate, all of these had
smaller amounts or smaller quantities of propellant available
than Apollo 13 does at the present time. The service pro-
pulsion system propellant on Apollo 13 stand untapped at
40 796 pounds. This was for planned total DELTA-V or velocity
change of some 6975 feet per second with various vehicle
combinations, not just command/service module alone, but in
some cases, such as lunar orbit insertion and DOI where you
have the total LM and command module combination, and others,
the transearth injection where only the command and service

pellant remaining. However, not all of this is available since
the supercritical helium burst disc relief valve blew during

Relief valves blew during the night. There
is about 800 feet per second blow down or ullage volume in
the descent propulsion tanks SO not all of this 11 000 pounds
are available. In the untapped ascent propellant tanks we
have 5242 pounds loaded. Service Module reaction control
system 1342 pounds are still relatively untapped except for
the small attitude usage that was made during the trans-
lunar coast prior to the time that the fuel cells gave up
the ghost. In the Command Module reaction control system
this is still a sealed dual ring system in the Command Module
for attitude control during entry. There are 245 pounds of
propellant available there. When the service module and lunar
module are jettisoned prior to entry approximately 29 tons
of what is jettisoned to enter the atmosphere and burn up
will be propellant. The spaceflight meteorology group of the
weather bureau said this morning that weather conditions would
be acceptable for Apollo 13's landing in the Pacific Ocean,
Friday, April 17, and the planned recovery area which is
centered about 560 miles Southeast of Samoa, skys will be
partly cloudly with widely scattered showers. Easterly winds
at 15 knots and seas about 4 feet are expected with 75 degree
temperature. Helen a small, weak, tropical storm is pre-
dicted to be about 500 miles west of the recovery area and
should not affect the landing or recovery of Apollo 13.

CAP COM Okay, Jim, Roger. We're going to do that
to the maximum extent possible. It looks reasonably feasible.
To begin with in the command module we're going to have to
send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little
bit at a time. The closer we get to entry the more we get on
the checklist. By the time we're about at EI minus 45 we're
on the checklist all the way.
SC
Okay.

And just as a reminder don't forget our
stowage problem. We still have to do quite a bit of storage
with the probe and drogue in the LM etc.
CAP COM Roger that. We've got a team working on
that and incidentally one of the information items that they
want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the com-
mand module are empty. They just want to know that for weight
and balance, and there's no rush about it.

PAO
This is Apollo Control. 120 hours 20 minutes
Apollo 13 is 108 867 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity
5585 feet per second. We're drawing an average of 18 to
19 amps from the descent stage batteries now that we continue
to charge the Battery A in the Command Module. Lunar Module
cabin temperature 51.
SC
Houston, over.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM For our benefit while we do this briefing, Jim we'd
like to have the COMM better and we can sure stir the
power so we'd like you on panel 16 to close the power amplifier
circuit breaker and on panel 12 we'd like you to move the
voice function switch to voice. Over.
CAP COM Okay Aquarius, Houston, How do you read.
SC
Read you loud and clear.
CAP COM
Okay.
CAP COM You're real good. It's a it's a pleasure
not to have all that noise. Let me tell you what I want
to do Jim. As I said, we're not going to give you detail
procedures now. What we expect to have for you shortly are
procedures which we'll try and get up to you in the following
form. First we'll have a timeline, sort of a flight plan
thing, which will have the times of all the measure events
and any configurations, switch settings, and so forth which
are peculiar to our configuration and which therefore you
won't find in the checklist. This, for instance, will be
true of the way we power up the command module and second,
of course, we'll have any red lines to the checklist so
that you can enter the checklist where possible to perform
functions and the timeline will simply refer you to the
checklist when that's appropriate. Okay?
SC
Okay. Sounds good. You're going to give
me an overall timeline now, I take it, is that right?
CAP COM That's affirm. I'm going to first of all
just quickly run through the times of the major events and
then we'll go back and fill in some of the details. Okay.
entry interface is at 142 hours 40 minutes. 6-1/2 hours,
roughly prior to that or at about 136 10 we'll start this
whole thing going by applying IMU heater power, by checking
the CM/RCS temperatures and pre-heating the CM/RCS if re-
quired and we suspect we'll probably want to do that. We'll
have detail procedures up for it later. At about 6 hours
prior to EI or about 136 40 we will commence powering up
the LM, powering up the AGS using the modified LM/DPS RCS
30 minute checklist which you have used for the previous
midcourse. Then shortly, just before 5 hours, prior to EI
or at about 13 740 we'll want you in the attitude for a

--- PAGE 738 ---
A POLLO 13 Mission commentary 4-16-70 CST 1:33P GET 120:20:11 528/2
CAP COM LM AGs, body axis alinement, using the Earth
terminator like we did before and as soon as we have that we'll
perform MCC7 which looks like now about a 2 foot per second
burn for about 15 seconds of RCS. And I'm told that it's
down to 1-1/2 now, so it's comfortably within the RCS marking.
Okay, when we do that we'll immediately start the maneuver to
the service module jettison attitude which will be in plane
since we're jettisoning it earlier than we usually do. We
don't need and don't want the out of plane component. So it'll
be in plane with the service module pointed back out along the
radius vector. We will then commence to get the command mod-
ule ready for service module SEP, including Command Module
RCS checkout and hot fire at approximately 4 hours and 30 min-
utes prior to EI or 138 10 we'll jettison the service module
We'll -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 739 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 1:37P GET 120:25:50 529/1
CAP COM approximately 4 hours 30 minutes prior
to EI or 138:10 we'll jettison the service module, we'll pitch
the LM up until we acquire the service module in the hatch
trying to get some photographs, but we're not going to fool
around with the LM's translation maneuvers for pictures because
we don't want to foul up your flight path angle at that time.
Okay, that gives us 2 hours of more or less open time here to
finish up. If we're late on that, go on over the checklist
and prepare for powering up the command module. We're going
to start the command module full powerup at EI minus 2 hours
and 30 minutes or 140:10 GET. We'll get the computer on the
line, we'll get the IMU up, we'll start uplinking your state
vector and so forth and alineing the command module platform.
At about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest, giving us an hour
to do this command module stuff, we will start the maneuver to
the LM jettison attitude. We'll not start to close out the
LM. (GARBLED) waiver for this. We'll close the hatch, do a
pressure integrity check and at EI minus 1 hour or 141 hours
and 40 minutes, we'll jettison the LM. As soon as we do that, you
can start the maneuver to the entry attitude. When you're there,
do a sextant star check, take down the optics, and at that point
we'll be giving you your final entry pad. You can initialize the
EMS and you'll essentially be right back on the checklist at that
point. There's one little difference from your nominal entry.
You're a little bit earlier (garbled) It's going to
be (garbled) when you get to EI. However, we're fortunate
enough to have the moon in a perfect position for a horizon
check. We'll give you a moon check instead of a horizon check
and you can track it right down to moonset, which is going
to be at EI roughly minus 3 minutes, and that's it for the
quick timeline. Do you have any questions right now?
SC
I don't believe so, Joe, right now. We'll
have to look at those timelines and think about it for a little bit.
CAP COM Okay, real fine. We're ready to talk in
some more detail about the alinement procedures, the CM powerup
procedures, etc., but why don't we give you a few minutes to
digest what you've already heard.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Aquarius.
SC
Two questions so far on heating up the
CM RCS. We assume that's LM power and we assume that we're
going to have to power up both CM buses, right?
CAP COM Okay, Jim, I didn't want to talk about
that because we're not quite ready to recommend a procedure.
We can't power up the CM RCS per the normal checklist on the LM
power because we haven't got quite enough amps. It may be that
we'll want you to heat to do the preheat one ring at a time
and we're looking at that. Another possibility is that we may

--- PAGE 740 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 1:37P GET 120:25:50 529/2
CAP COM want to take down LM power at that time,
do the preheat, and then go back to LM power until we have to
take it down finally. Over.
SC
Okay, understand. Second question, when
we finish MCC 7, that maneuver to SM jet attitude will be
angles given to us by you using the AGS aline ball, right?
CAP COM That's affirmative. Once we get that
AGS alined and get a time hack on it, the good people down here
will be able to give us AGS, AGS-8 ball attitudes for the service
module separation attitude, for the command module alinement
attitude, which we are going to pass you up a moon/sun P52 type
alinement. We'll have AGS 8 ball attitudes for those and we'll
be able to uplink through the command module once we get the
computer up. A preferred REFSMAT, which will be identical to
the LM attitude at the time of the burn, and we'll go into
details on that later.
SC
Okay. Just stand by one. I'll give you (garble)
CAP COM Will do.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70 CST 1:45P GET 120:31:55 530/1
AQUARIUS Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM Go ahead.
AQUARIUS We would like to have plenty of liquids
and then the control characteristics are of the LM command
module and whether we can use the attitude control only to
maneuver the combination to photograph the service module at
4 plus 30.
CAP COM Okay, good thinking. We are its - there
has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuver to let
you do to photograph the LM, I mean the service module. We
considere it quite low priority; the feeling is that it will
be real nice to get pictures of the service module but they are
not required for our trouble shooting program. As far as the
attitude control authority, and so forth, we will give you more
detailed word on that later, we are working it, it appears that
using the ACA instead of the TTCA after the service module jet
will give you excellent attitude control authority, and thats
what we recommend.
AQUARIUS Okay and I'm - use an AGS hold configuration
to keep the attitude - turn the LM jet attitude.
CAP COM That's affirm. We are probably going to
recommend a tight dead band ags attitude hold for that.
AQUARIUS Okay.
AQUARIUS Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead.
AQUARIUS Okay the star check and the entry attitude
is it a sextant star check or a COAS star check?
CAP COM It'll probably be a sextant star check Jim.
It really depends on how good that platform is that we get -
star check.
CAP COM While we are at it I want to mention one
thing to Jack; as I said, this CSM alinement procedure we are
going to recommend is a moon/sun, and there are sun filters stowed
they are stowed in compartment R1, however, they are for the
telescope only of course, not the sextant, one is for the long
eye relief piece, the other for the normal eye piece. And if
he has any questions about that, we'll be glad to talk about it.
AQUARIUS Okay.
AQUARIUS And because it will be too late to do
much about a hatch integrity check of the LM, you want us to have
our suits on sometime during this period?
CAP COM Okay Jim, we are laying for you on that one;
it is a subject that we wanted to bring up with you. We have
been considering it, and our feelings are of course - it is
up to you - as we see the pros and cons, you just put your finger
on the pro we do a hatch integrity check shortly before EI minus
1 hour, and if we busted, you would have a hard time scrambling
into the suits; on the other hand, the disadvantages of wearing

--- PAGE 742 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70 CST 1:45 P GET 120:31:55 530/2
CAP COM the suits are that they might slow you down
considerably not even counting the time you don them, and someone
is even very concerned that after such and such a period of
time in the suits, you might get the warm, and we might have
to power up the suit loop to ventilate the suits and we don't
particularly want to do that cause it cost quite a bit of power.
Consequently, our recommendation would be not wear the suit,
since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will
show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate and we can
certainly hack that.
CAP COM What do you think? Over.
AQUARIUS Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long
as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no reason
why we need the suits and one thing we are going to do during
our spare time is to practice putting that hatch on, make sure
we get it on and locked.
CAP COM Okay, real good. And with that precaution,
I think we can concur on that decision.
AQUARIUS And that's all the questions we had about
the time line you gave us.
CAP COM Okay, let me take a check here and see if
there is anything anybody - -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 743 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 1:51P GET 120:30:30 531/1
CAP COM
concur on that decision.
SC
And that's all the questions we
had about the time line you gave us.
CAP COM Okay. Let me take a check here and
see if there is anything anybody else wants to input to you
right now.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Roger. One detail, that I thought
you ought to know about the service module jet is that we're
going to recommend a push pull manuever, that is in the
attitude I described. We'll want you to go half a foot
per second plus X on the LM, then jettison the service
module and go half a foot per second minus X, which will be
less time because your suddenly a heck of a lot lighter. Over.
SC
Okay. Understand. You want me to
go a half a foot per second plus X, jet the service module
and go a half a foot per second minus X.
CAPCOM That's affirm. We think that will
give you plenty of separation, and also will be a slow
enough rate so you' have a chance to get some photos.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, one more thing we want to update
you on with a little detail. As we told you, the ascent sep
attitude was in plane and the LM jet attitude will be more
similar to a normal service module SEP attitude, that is
it will be LM UP out the radius vector and 45 degrees right
out of plane toward the south. We are going to recommend
that prior to jet, the configuration be with the LM overhead
hatch CLOSED, with the vent valve OPEN, and we'll jet with
the tunnel pressurized. Over.
SC
Okay, Joe. Understand that the LM
jet attitude will be similar to that of service module normal
jettison, which will be up and out of plane, and as soon as
I finish manuevering the left jet attitude, I'll scramble up
and close the LM hatch, making sure the vent valve is open,
and then we'll jettison with the tunnel pressurized.
CAP COM That's affirmative. And Deke says,
don't forget to close the command module hatch on your way
in.
SC
I'm already scared that Jack will have
it closed before I get up there.
CAP COM (Laughter) Okay, Jim. I Think that's
about all we have for you right now. Whenever you feel like
you don't have any more questions at the moment, we'd like
you to reconfigure for downvoice backup and we'd like you
to do that to move the voice functions switches downvoice
backup switches (garble) but instead of pulling the circuit
breaker, we'd like you to throw the power temp switch to OFF.
Over.

--- PAGE 744 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 1:51P GET 120:30:30 531/2
SC
Okay, Joe. I have one more question
here. If we get a little bit ahead of time on the command
module full power up, after we jettison the service module,
I'd like to go to LM jet attitude early and make sure we
get that part squared away and sit there for awhile before
LM jet of 1 hour. Now, will we be using LM power up to that
time? There are 2 cables that we'll probably have to dis-
connect on the way up through the tunnel or are we still
going to use LM power?
CAP COM That's affirmative. Let me get word
on when we expect to go off LM power.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Roger. We expect to go off LM power
at the time we start powering up the CSM or about minus 2-1/2
hours. That is not a hard number and we'll be updating you
on it. As far as going to the LM jet attitude. That's com-
pletely permissable as soon as you have a powered up command
module and a satisfactory platform, you can go there immediately.
We're giving you a maximum of 1 hour just for grunts. Over.
SC
Okay. Fine, and

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 1:58P GET 120:45:30 532/1

- Just for grants. Over.
SC
Okay. Fine, and then we'll be a LM
maneuver, I assume, because you want the service module, SO
no strain there.
CAP COM
Fine.
SC
And, Jack, we'd like to know what
entry angle the midcourse will give us?
CAP COM Oh, it'll put us right in the middle
of the corridor, Jim.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
6.50 degrees.
CAP COM And, Jim, Houston. I just, as a
last item, we expect that it will take us about an hour to
update your checklist in your timelines sometime later on
today, and we'd just like you to consider that. I expect
it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready.
SC
Okay, we'll be standing by for that
and, now power amplifier switch is going to go off, and then
we'll be going to down-voice backup.

up the CM and look at your TM, we have a couple of additional
steps.
SC
Okay, Vance, I do have the procedure for
stopping the battery charge and do you want me to copy this
procedure now or do you want me to come back and give you the
volt amps and time after I complete this termination?
CAP COM Okay. Just give us the volts and amps
just before you start the termination of the procedure and
understand you say you have the procedure for taking the
charge off. Is that affirm?
SC
That's affirmative.
CAP COM
Okay. And just give us a hack on the time.
SC
You want to review it at all?
CAP COM Negative. Unless you want me to. I'll
tell you what. I can run through it very quickly just to
verify that we are getting started off on the correct path
here.
SC
Yes. Okay, the first four or five
things I have is panel bat charge to off panel 3, AC
inverter 2 off, panel 5, Main bus 5, bat AC on, panel 250,
CB bat A, py-entry post-landing open, panel 275 inverter
power to main B open and that

- py-entry post landing OPEN; panel 275 is
inverter power 2 MAIN B; OPEN; and then, just to go ahead
and reverse the position of the switches and circuit breakers
that I started out with and these don't have to be in reverse
order. Is that, Charlie?
CAP COM
Roger, that's that's Charlie. Have at it.
SC
Okay, we'll get a volts and amps right now.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, Vance. The volts and amps 39.4; amps
1.25.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack. We copy that.
CAP COM
Incidentally -
SC
Did you say we're going up the tunnel?
(Garble), Vance.
CAP COM Never mind, Jack. I'll bring this up later
when you've finished the procedure.
SC
Okay, I'm going off the air, I'll put Fredo on,
I'm going to stop the battery charge.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Now, how do you read, Vance?
CAPCOM Hey, loud and clear, Fred. Understand you've
been doing some spring housecleaning; moving stowage around
up there.
SC
Boy, you wouldn't believe this LM right now;
there's nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.
CAP COM Hey, that brings up a question. We were
wondering where you guys plan to stow the progue and drogue?
It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the
LM; down about where the LMP normally stands underneath the
IS - ISAer. Perhaps you have a better idea? Over.
SC
Yes, I do, Vance. That would go in the LM,
but I thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR stands.
How's that?
CAP COM Okay, I can tell that you're just getting -
getting that one over cause Jim just got off the loop.
SC
Hey, he's sleeping. No, that's - that's
actually where we normally had been stowing it for normal
LM jettison.
CAP COM Okay, and Hey, we just we'll record that,
and figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over in
the where the CDR stands. We have a - a change to this -
equipment transfer list that I just read up to Jim. Why
don't you make a note of this one item? Forget about the
LM -
SC
Standby, standby one.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
I think Jack hauled off the piece of paper
with that all that on it. Why don't you hold it until
Jack gets done doing the battery charge?
CAPCOM Okay. And Fred request PCM on LOW BIT RATE,
now.
SC
Okay. And there was one piece of flight

--- PAGE 756 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 3:5 8P GET 122:45 542/2
SC
- data that we needed that we didn't bring
along this time.
CAP COM
What was that?
SC
That's a big book with a lot of just plain
old blank pages in it.
CAP COM Yes, when you when you get off the nominal,
why you just need scratch paper, don't you?
SC
Yes.
SC
Okay, Vance. I got the stowage list, now.
CAP COM
Okay, I gave you two lists -
SC
And Jack - and Jack said he's completed -
the - secured the battery charge, now.
CAP COM Okay, and we're recording the time that
that was complete. You have two lists there; one is LM to
CM equipment transfer; and the second list is the reverse.
Request you scratch the last item on the first list; which
is; returning used bags back to the CM.
SC
Okay. We didn't have any of those, so that
didn't pose any problem any -

CAP COM
Okay.

Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Okay, Vance. Aquarius is back on.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack understand you completed
securing the battery charge. Now if you are ready to copy,
Jack I would like to give you the changes that we have to
the power up for the CM procedure. Over.
SC
Okay, Stand by one.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, Vance you say you have some
changes in the procedure that I use before to get telemetry
to check out the CSM.
CAP COM Yea, that's correct, Jack, they are
pretty simple. About half way through the procedure we have
a step on panel 3 which is power in HIGH we would like to
change that to power in LOW.
SC
Okay, copy power in LOW.
CAP COM And the next change, Jack is Panel 275
scratch the step CD Main B BAT B CLOSED. BAT Bus B CLOSED.
SC
Okay, you want delete the step CD
Main B, BAT Bus B CLOSED.
CAP COM Rog. As you know we are going to do
this on LM power, SO this reflects that.
SC
Okay, real fine.
CAP COM Okay and have at it, we'd like to have
the TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the data for
the CM, look at your temperatures, et cetera and after that
we will go back to charging the battery again and the charge
will probably go until around GET 126.
SC
Okay. You want the same read outs
from me that I gave you before?
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jack and just to
make sure that there is no mistaking the procedure it starts
out for the backout part, Panel 3 power amp OFF transponder
OFF; AC inverter 2 OFF; then gose to Panel 250, et cetera.
SC
That's the way I read it.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, going back up into the refrigerator.
CAP COM
Hey, I thought it was the bedroom.
SC
Well, it's got a new name now, because
it is about 30 degrees cooler.
CAP COM
Roger, returning to the deep freezer.
SC
Hey, there is one thing that I wanted
to ask you on the stowage list where you have us putting the
black and white camera on top of A7 in a decontamination
bag, I was wondering if it would be possible if there would

--- PAGE 758 ---

- along with the 70 millimeter Hasselblad
camera.
CAP COM Jack, I don't think there will be any
problem if you can get it in but let us work that and get back
with you. Okay.
SC
Alright, I was just thinking. I'm trying to get
as much weight as possible, down there in that LEB. We
have no SRC's and then our waste tank is rather depleted. I
think it is about down to 40 percent or SO. So I'm trying to
get as much L over D as I can and any heavy items we can get
down there, it will be greatly appreciated if you will bring
it to our attention.
CAP COM Okay. We copy that and we owe you an
answer on your last question.
SC
Okay. And I'm in work and going to give
you some telemetry.
CAPCOM
Okay.

CAP COM Fred, just lost data on Jack, would
you have him select best omni, please?

Service Module telemetry check. The current is up now to
24 amps.

Allright, go ahead.
CAP COM
Fred, we have enough data, recommend
that Jack take off the TM and power back down again, using
his backout procedure, just let us know when he does it.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
And after that we will start the
battery charge and we'll have to know when he starts that.
SC
Okay, he's starting to backout now.
Just out of curiosity are ya'll going to read out on what
the cabin temp was up there?
CAP COM Yea, we're getting 45 to 46 degrees.
SC
Now you see why we call it the
refrigerator.
CAP COM Yea, it's kind of a cold winter day
up there isn't it? Is it snowing in the Command Module yet?
SC
Is it what, Vance?
CAP COM
Is it snowing in there yet?
SC
Oh, snowing, no - no not quite, the
windows are in pretty bad shape and I guess the Service
Module will be trying to shoot out of the LM window, because
every window in the Command Module is covered with water
droplets. It's going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those
cleared off.
CAPCOM
Roger, understand.
CAP COM Pete says to tell you you'll have
some time on the beach in Samoa to thaw out after this cold
experience.
SC
Hey, that sounds great.
SC
Vance, have ya'll thought about what
cameras ya'll wanted to use. Right now we have got configured
a Hasleblad with a 250 and I've got the lunar surface number
one Hasleblad and I've got the lunar surface sequence camera
also rigged and ready to go. Did you have any other druthers
about the (garble)
CAP COM You are referring to the photography
of the Service Module, is that right?
SC
That's right.
CAP COM We have some procedures in work and
I've seen them, Fred. I think pretty soon we'll be shooting
them up to you to specify which camera and setting. But that

SC
Okay, you might let them know that
if they had thought of it we've got this lunar surface sequence
camera onboard which has it's own battery pack set up
and it shoots quite a few pictures and that could also be
used.

Okay and we are charging bat. A.
CAP COM Roger. Charging bat A, Fred.
And, Fred, request now first reading of voltage, bat A voltage
and charger current. Over.
SC
Okay, Vance. Thank you. I could give
it to you. I read it right after I started it. Bat A voltage
was 39.4 and the current had jumped up to 1.4.

Okay. You ready for some more readouts.
CAP COM
Ready to copy.

Okay. Bat B 37.0, pyro A 37.0, pyro B
37.0, SPS helium pressure 3400 and Nitrogen A and B just
thrown in for kicks, 2200 and 2400 respectively and the

You say you figure you are going to be
charging bat A until about 126?
CAP COM Roger. About 1 26 30 is the estimate,
Jack.
SC
Okay. You figure it will be fully
charged then, huh?
CAP COM Yes. That's right. We'll have all the
batteries up to about 116 amps hours.
SC
That's good news.
CAP COM
That's better than 99, huh?
SC
You're right.
SC
How did all our systems look on (garble), Vance?
CAP COM
I didn't hear any complaints. Just a
minute let me make a detailed check.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM It's a general statement. It looks like
temperatures have cooled off the ball park of 6 to 8 degrees cooler
than what they were yesterday. Looks like everything is still
within tolerance, but we're working up a detailed sheet of
temperatures to send up to you for your interest.

SC
Vance, Joe brought up the alignment at
EI minus 2 plus 30. You'd better set up or have a discussion about
that later on.
CAP COM That's correct, Jack. We just about have
procedures in hand detail checklist type procedures to send
to you. In other words, a timeline with reference to entry
checklist and any changes in the entry checklist SO if you
have a few pages of scratch paper, I think we'll have that
to you within an hour. One other thing, Jack, you still
with me?
SC
Yes. Go ahead. The stowage people
have tried out this black and white TV camera into B6 idea
and they say even with the lens off, they can't get it in
so I still recommend that it be stowed where we had it on the
list. That's A7 -

All of the shifts are morning shifts
to us, because the sun is always shinning.

Just for curiosity sake are we still
holding entry angle at 6.5?

it's closer to 6, but they would like to track it some more,
looks like your next midcourse will be in the order of 2
to 3 foot per second.

with the integrity of the Command Module tunnel hatch, they
will make this reentry unsuited.

We have got a good view of the
Southern Cross (garble) Houston.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Jack.
SC
Okay, we're still in good shape as
far as water goes in the LM?
CAP COM
Okay, we copy.
SC
The reason I ask is because I am
assuming that we are and I have no idea each time I
pressurize the surge tank to get water out of the Command
Module, how much I drop that surge tank and if we are in
good shape as far as water goes in the LM we'd like to fill
a couple of drink bags to get some water for drinking
purposes.
CAP COM Okay, have you run out of CM drinking
water yet, Jack?
SC
Oh no, we have plenty of drinking
water, I think the - I don't have any idea what the (garble)
tank pressure is.

Okay. 750.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. Stand by, Jack, and
we'll give you an indication of how that water situation on
the LM is which is your question. Right?
SC
Okay. But I guess what I was really
asking is if you'd have any violent objections if we filled
two drinks bags from LM water rather than repressurizing the
thirst tank.
CAP COM
Okay. Stand by.
SC
Also Jim is asleep up there and we didn't
want to bother him either.
CAP COM Okay. We understand. And, Jack, we'll
be changing stations in one minute so we may have a temporary
dropout in COMM.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Okay, Vance, go ahead. Loud and clear.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack, we're going to bargain with
you on this one. Instead of two, we wish that you would get
just one bag full. That shouldn't do any harm; however, we
are not all that fat on water that we want to do any drinking
out of the LM as a regular thing after this one bag. So would
you let us know when you get the water out and give us a mark
on it so we can watch the TM. Over.
SC
Okay. Fred-o is about to withdraw the
water now.
SC
Okay. We've withdrawn about 8 ounces
of water.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack, how does it taste?

It's kind of good. It's not quite as
gassey as that in the command module.

of them to be used for picture taking from the LM, one to
be used from the number 5 window on the CSM. First off
get the LM cameras. And this camera that I mention now has
first priority and is considered the one to give you the
best results. That's the 70 millimeter DC Reseau camera
Hasselblad that is with the 80 millimeter lens, from box A13.
Suggest fresh magazine of 3400 black and white film.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM Okay, suggest either magazine R or
magazine S from A13. Transfer all of this to the LM
END OF TAPE

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 5:54P GET 124:41:00 553/1
CAP COM - and recommend the following settings.
LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (F5.6) at a 250th. And that's all for that
one.
SC
Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it
here. For the LM want to use the 70 millimeter EC Hasselblad
80 millimeter lens at A 13 on the using 3400 black and white
film mag R or S. Prepare to take into of the LM and the
setting would be the LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (F5.6) at a 250th.
CAP COM That's correct. Okay. Next. The
next camera stand by one. I've got noise here. Okay, the
next camera for the LM will be 16 millimeter and these photos
are considered to be priority 3. Okay. one, get the 16 millimeter
dac and powerpack from A8. Get the 10 millimeter lens and
remove the 10 millimeter lens and take the 18 millimeter lens
from B3 and attach it to the camera and attach the power
cable, transfer to the LM, set frame range at 12 frames per
second and the same data line that I gave you before reads
this way this time. LM/Dac/18/CEX, battery (F8 and 1/250th.)
Okay, now looking at these two cameras in the LM it is recommended
that you use the 16 millimeter for the first 2 and one-half
minutes and then switch to the 70 millimeter. That's partly
because the frames been - they have been optimized for closer
longer range. Okay. Read back, please.
SC
Okay, Vance. I guess this is what you
wanted to use as far as the movie camera in the LM goes is
our lunar sequence camera which is attached to the power pack.
We use the 18 millimeter lens, set it at 12 frames per second
(garble) F8, 250th of a second.
CAP COM Roger. F8 and 250th.
SC
Right F8 and 250th.
CAP COM Okay. Would you believe we have a
correction now to the last camera I gave you. Correct that
18 millimeter lens to 75 millimeter lens.
SC
Okay. The 18 millimeter to 75 millimeter.
lens. Okay.
CAP COM Right. Okay. Next for the command
module pictures. It may be a little hard to see the service
module from the command module, but if you can see it, it will
be through window 5, people down here think. Recommend for
that the CN 70 millimeter. Those photos have priority 2.
So this is 70 millimeter EL which has 80 millimeter attached
and this is all in B3. Take off the 80 millimeter lens and
attach the 250 millimeter lens.

CAP COM And the 250 millimeter lens can be
found in U4. Use CEX film from A13. Ring site from A7 and
these pictures will F8 at a 250. And I think probably by
now you probably already have these cameras configured and
this may be redone on information, but here it is anyway.
Over.
SC
Okay, Vance you're right, we do have
cameras almost configured like you said. For the Command
Module, you think that the EL or the 250 lens CEX flim
F8 at a 250 is the best set and you're saying now that
where you think that you will see it is out the window 5,
is that it?
CAP COM
That's right, Jim.
SC
Okay, my procedure now after Service
Module jet is going to be to PITCH up, in order to try to
get the Service Module into the to get the center window
in view of the Service Module which we are going to have
somebody there to take a photograph. Why do you think window
5 will be it?
CAP COM
Okay, stand by on that one. This is
a question of geometry, and I will be right back.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 124 hours
55 minutes. Apollo 13 now 93 329 nautical miles from Earth,
velocity 6148 feet per second. We're 12 hours 45 minutes
away from the planned last midcourse correction. Tracking
to date indicates that would be about a 3.4 feet per second
DELTA-V. If it stays around that number, it will probably
be done with the reaction control system, it would be a
25 second duration burn with reaction control system. Capcom
Vance B Rand will pass up more information here shortly on the
photography task as the Service Module seperates and we will
stand by for that.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, over.

Jim, regarding window 5, I have a
drawing here and when you're docked you have approximately
a 60 degree angle between the Z axis of the two -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 772 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 6:11P GET 124:58:00 555/1
CAPCOM - you'd have approximately a 60 degree
angle between the Z axes of the two spacecraft. It appears
that peering out window 5 you would be looking at the
rendezvous radar on top of the LM which would - if you
pitched more or less to give you a view of the service
module. That is, if you pitched, so - from and I think
that this has been run by quite a few folks here SO offhand
I can't see why any other window would be as good or perhaps
even possible.
SC
Okay. Understand. Yeah. You're
right. When we look out window 5 we can see rendezvous radar.
And we'll try window 5.
CAPCOM Rog. It presumes though that there
has to be a pitch to be able to see it. You guys sound a
lot more rested today.
SC
Well, I just went back and sacked out
for an hour or S 0 and just got back up.
CAP COM Very good.
CAP COM And Jim, Houston. We really are
going to get those checklists up to you.

Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Jim.
SC
Okay, we have no more water in the potable tank;
we tried to get some more out a few minutes ago, and there
isn't any.
CAP COM
Okay, understand you ran out of water in the
CM potable tank.
SC
Affirmative.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 125 hours, 24 min-
utes. We have an update now on the lunar module consumables
lifetime. These figures include powering up the LM at
136 hours, 15 minutes elapse time. Including that power up
we have enough water for 30.7 more hours. The - enough
oxygen for 140 enough oxygen for 146 hours, and -
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
SC
Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM
Jim, we you we're you able to get those

SC
Oh, yes, just a minute, Fred's - Fred's up
there now.
CAP COM
Okay. And we're ready to read you the first
checklist installment. This will - what we're going to read-
up is going to be a LM timeline; a CSM timeline; and checklist
changes to conform with these. And, right now I have the
first installment of the CSM timeline; ready to read up. Over.
SC
Okay, Jack. I'm going to get - Vance, I'm
going to get Jack on the line for that; and so standby.
CAP COM Okay. And he' 11 need a lot of paper.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 6:40 GET 125:27:00 557/1
AQUARIUS Okay, Jack, I mean Vance, I'm going
to get Jack on the line for that and so stand by.
CAP COM Okay, and he'll need a lot of paper.
AQUARIUS Okay. Volts are 39.5 amps 1.24. Stand by.
CAP COM
Okay, we got it.
PAO
Time remaining on the electrical power
at 22 and 1/2 hours, which would bring us to an elapsed time
of 100, would bring us to an elapsed time on the electrical
power of 147 hours 30 minutes. The water remaining would
bring us to elapsed time of 155 hours 42 minutes.
AQUARIUS On and ready to go.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. Wait one, we want to get
one into the hands of flight EECOM and it'll take about a
minute or two. Sorry to wake you up for this but take about
a minute and then we'll read it up to you.
PAO
And we have about 137 hours worth of
lithium hydroxide left. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide
in the lunar module now, is at 3 tenths of a milimeter of
mecury. The 146 hours of oxygen left in the lunar module
would bring us to an elapsed time of 271 hours. We're at
17 hours 11 minutes away from entry into the earth's
atmosphere. Jim Lovell reported a short time ago, that the
portable water tank in the command module has gone dry.
There is enough of a pad in lunar module water, though that
the crew would not have to go thirsty.
AQUARIUS Okay, Vance, go ahead.
CAP COM Hey, Jack, do you have any of the CM
water, bagged water left? Over.
AQUARIUS Negative. I went up and tried to
repressurize the surge tank and get another shot of water
and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay but there
was no water that came out of the water tank.
CAP COM Yes, we understand that there isn't
any more in the portable tank, but we understood that you
had put some water from that tank into bags, and I wondered
if any of the bags were left.
AQUARIUS Negative.
CAP COM
Okay.
CAP COM
Okay, Jack, ready to copy?
AQUARIUS Okay, Vance, ready to copy.
CAP COM Okay. Start at EI minus 6 and 1/2 hours.
You're going to get LM pads and CSM pads and I don't know if
you want to copy them or not. This is something I can just
read off to you, without your copying unless you 'specially
want to.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM
Okay, LM pads SM jettison.
AQUARIUS Okay, go ahead, read which ones we're
going to get.
CAPCOM Okay, I'll read them fast, first here

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 6:40 GET 125:27:00 557/2
CAPCOM so you get a general idea. LM pad
service module jet attitude, moon viewing, attitude, sun
viewing attitude, and LM jet attitude. The CM pads are
course align angles for LM attitudes during moon and sun
sightings, course align angles for entry REFSMAT, and CMC
angles on entry REFSMAT for LM jet, moon viewing and entry.
Okay, that's general pad information. If you want I'll read
it slowly so you can copy it down, otherwise I've read it.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 6:48P GET 125:35:00 558/1
CAP COM - general pad information. If you
want, I'll read it slowly SO you can copy it all down other-
wise I'll go ahead.
SC
I got - I was trying to copy it as you
were reading it, Vance. The LM pads, service module jettison
attitude, moon viewing attitude, sun viewing attitude and LM
jettison attitude. Is that correct?
CAP COM That's correct. Okay, I'll read the
CM pads now slowly. Course align angles for LM attitudes
during moon and sun sightings. Okay, the next, course align
angles for entry REFSMATT. Okay, the next, CMC angles on
entry REFSMATT for 1 LM jet to moon viewing, 3 entry. Okay,
I'll stand by until you read that back.
SC
Okay. CSM pads will be course align
angles for LM attitudes during moon and sun settings. Course
align angles for entry REFSMATT. CMC angles are entry
REFSMATT for 1 LM jettison, 2 moon viewing 3, entry.
CAP COM Okay. That's correct.
CAP COM Jack, I'm going to hold up one. The
hordes of people who devised this procedure are going to be
coming into the room in a minute and they'd like to hold up
until everybody can listen in.
CAP COM
Get that, Jack?
SC
Okay, Vance, we're ready to go.
CAP COM We lost you there briefly while you
were in an attitude where we couldn't receive you. Jack, we'd
like to hold off for about 5 minutes. We have some more people
coming in to listen to this and it took a lot of people to
devise this procedure and a few people have been testing it
out so we'd like to have them all on hand while we give you
the rest.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM How's the temperature up there, Jack.
You guys chopping wood to keep warm?
SC
Deke, I think it's about 51, I think, or
50 in the LM and it's about 45 or little bit less in the
command module.
CAP COM
Nice fall day, huh?
SC
I tell you, we don't have to worry about
chill-down.
SC
Vance, while we are waiting, do you
have there also when I can expect ground to uplink me?
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 777 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 6:56P GET 125:43:00 559/1
SC
- fence ground to uplink B.
CAP COM
We'll have that Jack, but stand by
for that.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
Jack. Probably the thing to do is
to give you all of the checklist and it will include things
like this. Then we'll have a big question and answer session
afterwards. If that's okay by you.
SC
Okay. That sounds good.
SC
Okay Vance. While we're waiting,
just for your information the command module has been stowed
per your checklist with the exception of the two Hasselblad
cameras.
CAP COM
Rog. Got that Jack.
SC
And the LM is pretty well stowed
with the exception when we have yet to bring in the probe
and the drogue.
CAPCOM
Rog. Got that.
PAO
That's Deke Sleyton talking to Jack
Swigert.
CAP COM Relative to your water situation Jack,
we're going to have a pretty good hack on the LM here in the
next few hours and we anticipate letting you fill your own
tanks before we transfer over so we should be in reasonably
good shape there.
SC
Okay. We have a number of juice
bags all cut and ready to go and we tried to get the water
out of the command module about 12 - 20 minutes ago and
found out that the command module's portable tank was empty.
So we have no bags made up now so we're dependent on LM
water and PLSS` water.
CAP COM Rog. If you feel like trying the
PLSS that's all excess, and you might want to try that at
any time.
CAP COM I'm sure it'll taste like PLSS but
you might as well try it.
SC
Okay.
SC
Okay Deke. All the windows in the
command module are heavily coated with water right now. So
I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get out of them but
I'm going to try and clean them off and do the best I can
with the 250 millimeter lens in the Hasselblad.
CAP COM Rog. Just so we have the top priority
stuff in the LM. We figure you've got a much better chance
of getting it through there.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Are you ready to send it up Vance.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 6:56P GET 125:43:00 559/2
CAP COM Jack, before we start reading the
procedure, we'd like - we find that batt A is topped off
and in great shape. Like to switch over and top off batt
B some more. Give it 2 more hours of charging. Have about
a 7 or 8 step procedure here to give you if you want to
copy that. Switching before we start reporting the entry
procedures.
SC
Okay. Stand by and let me get out
my other checklist.

Okay, I'll put it in work right now, and then
come back and standby to copy the rest of well, I've got
the rest of everything.
CAP COM Everything is right. You'd never believe how
much this procedure's been massaged in the last day.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 126 hours. Apollo 13
is 89 401 nautical miles from Earth. Velocity is 6320 feet
per second. Jack Swigert's in the process of discontinuing
the charge on battery A in the command module. And then they
will hook up to BATT - -, the command module battery B and
will charge that for about 2 hours top it off.

quite as stabilized. It was reading 1.1 amps 39.6 volts when
I left up there.
CAP COM
Okay. Got that.
SC
Okay. I guess now is as good a time
to start as any.
CAPCOM
Just a second, Jack.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Okay, Vance. your're kind of weak, but
readable.
CAP COM Jack, we're going to need readings on
the bat volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 minutes
for awhile SO is there somebody else who can be reading them
out while you are copying them?
SC
Yes. Jim will take a run up there.
Fred-o is sleeping right now. We are trying to get some
sleep here and Jim'll run up and take a look at voltage and
current when you call.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Aquarius.
SC
Vance, we've got to realize that we've
got to establish a work-rest cycle up here so we can't just
wait around here to read the procedures all the time up to the
burn. We've got to to get them up here, look at them and then
we've got to get the people to sleep. So take that into
consideration when you get ready to send up the pads.
CAP COM I know, Jim. We're very conscious
of that. We should be ready to go in about 5 minutes. That's
all I can say. Stand by.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Okay, Vance, we're ready to go.
CAP COM
Okay, we need a sorry - we need a
readout. Volts and amps.

CAPCOM Okay, next step, panel 12 S-band function
to voice and ranging function to ranger.
AQUARIUS Okay, Vance. The S-band function is
voice and the ranging switch was a ranger.
CAP COM Okay, that makes it SO we can hear you
better Jack.
AQUARIUS Okay, can we, this is the first part of
it, you're just going to read and I'm going to copy and we're
going to have a question and answer period later. Can we
get started?
CAP COM Okay, the procedures coming back in
again. Multi copies for distribution and Ken's back, he's
a local expert on that now, so we'll turn you over to him
and he'll read it off.
AQUARIUS Okay stand by, I'll give volts and amps.

Ken Mattingly will read the procedures.
AQUARIUS Voltages 39.1 amps 1.75
CAP COM
Okay.
CAPCOM Hello Aquarius, Houston, how do you
read?
AQUARIUS Okay, very good Ken.
CAP COM Okay, let me take it from the top here.
There might be some overlap, but to make sure we're all on
the same signal. We're starting off with a set of time-line
procedures that are going to give us, end up with the normal
entry checklist. There will be some checklist changes into
the book, but the bulk of what I have for you is the time
lines. And it starts at six hours 30 minutes prior to EI
and assumes that we're getting LM power to main B in the
command module. I think you already have the numbers for
the LM pads and the command module pads, I mean the types of
pads we'll be giving you. And if you have a question on
what they '11 be doing or what they're for, I can go over
those now or when we get through.
AQUARIUS Okay. Yes I'll make a little note
there and we'll discuss this when we get everything copied.
CAP COM Alright. And the first item then after
you get ready to start this checklist is to install lithium
hydroxide canisters and stow ordeal On panel 8 we want to
turn the flood lights to fixed.
AQUARIUS Okay, wait a minute here, you're going
too fast.
CAP COM Okay, I'll tell you. I'll go line at
a time and wait for your verification before I go on to the
next one. I have panel 8 flood lights fixed.
AQUARIUS Okay, install LIOH canisters, stow
ordeal. flood lights fixed.
CAP COM Okay, that's the panel 8 flood lights.
Now we're going to take panel 5 and put the flood light
reostat at flood and the LEB that's panel 100 flood lights
also going to fixed. And the purpose of this is to balance
up BUSes A and B.

command module is using this for information only. This will
be the LM doing an Earth terminator AGS alinement; and at the
time of 5 plus 05 is the time they'll be going ahead and
releasing their ball. And, this will be covered in the LM
checklist it'll be uplinked after this one. At EI minus 5
we perform midcourse number 7. Over.
SC
Okay, at EI minus 505; the LM is making an
Earth terminator align; and at EI minus 500 we perform MCC 7.
CAP COM That's correct. At the completion of mid-

this and the command module RCS pressurization both by your-
self.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. Now, the next event is going to
be the separation of the service modules and these are some
Lm steps but so that you will know what is going on, I'll
read them to you. The LM will do a LM plus X of one-half foot

--- PAGE 788 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 7:45P GET 126:32:00 565/2
CAP COM per second. Then you'll be hitting the
CMSM sep on and up on their command. As soon as we are free
of the service module, the LM will do another LM minus X
for .58 per second. This is called the push-pull maneuver.
I think it was described this afternoon.
SC
Yes, Ken, I heard about it.
CAP COM Okay. I just wanted you to know that's
the sequence you're in. Okay, at the completion of that,
we'll go back to panel 8 and it's sequential PYRO ARM, both
of them, to SAFE.
SC
Okay. panel 8 set PYRO ARM to SAFE.
CAP COM
Okay. and following this, we take
sequential logic 2 to OFF.
SC
Logic 2 to OFF.
CAPCOM I'm sorry, Jack, I'll have to ask you
to repeat that.
SC
Okay. Panel 8 set logic 2 to OFF.
Are they on now, Ken. I don't remember I guess that's what
I want -

AQUARIUS two are off. Are they on now Ken?
I don't remember turning, I guess they were part of the other
sequences when we turned them off.
CAP COM That's afirm. The reason we're turning
the logic off Jack is a power savings. So we'll be turning
them off and I'll be getting them back on when we go to get
off of the LM and then turn them back off then we'll be turning
them back on prior to entry. Just so you know what's coming.
AQUARIUS Okay, real fine.
CAP COM Okay. Then following that the LM will
pitch up to acquire the moon proximity, excuse me, they're
going to pitch up and acquire. the service module and photograph
and they'll be using the ACA for rotation from now on. And
you may see the LM out of window number 5 at the same time
they pitch up to acquire.
AQUARIUS Okay, the LM pitches up acquires the
service module and photograph it and I should expect to
find my (garbled) service module out of window number 5.
CAP COM That's affirmative. Okay, now we're
down to EI minus 3 hours, the next time-event and the LM
starts a maneuver to what we call the moon view attitude.
This maneuver is designed to place the command module optics
pointing 00 at the moon and it will be flown to on the LM
ball angle.
AQUARIUS Okay, the LM maneuvers to the moon viewing
attitude which would place the moon in the center of the
command module optics with them at 00.
CAP COM That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going
to panel 5. And it's circuit breaker G&N computer main B
closed.
AQUARIUS Okay, panel 5 CB G&N computer main B closed.
CAP COM That's affirmative. Now you're going
to come up with a 37 enter 0 enter most likely on the
computer. And what we want to do is to put the computer
to stand by and you come up with a 3706 you'll have to do
an enter in order to get the code 62. If its got 62 on it
you can do a procede until the disky blanks. You might
remember that the AC is still off at this time so you won't
be getting the stand by status light, and you're cue to the
computer is indeed in stand by is when the disky goes blank.
AQUARIUS Okay, you're saying that I will probably
get a program 06 with a VE RB 37 enter flashing.
CAP COM I expect that you
AQUARIUS 06
CAPCOM I expect you're -
AQUARIUS Say again Ken.
CAP COM Yes. We think that you're going to
come up with a 3706 already on the disky. If you do do an
enter and that should take you to the code 00062 which is
the request for stand by. And when you get that, then procede
until the disky blanks. If you come up with something else

--- PAGE 790 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 7:52P GET 126:44:00 566/2
CAP COM that's where we want to end up anyhow.
With either, when you get the code 62 when it comes up, just
do a procede on it.
AQUARIUS Okay. Is there anything else I could
get?
CAP COM I don't believe so, Jack, that's one
that when you get to that step if you do get something else
we will be standing by to see what you see. The whole scheme is
to go to stand by.
AQUARIUS Will you be gettint it on down-link.
CAP COM No sir, we don't have that powered yet.
AQUARIUS Okay, I'll yell to Jim and Jim will
give you a call.
CAP COM Okay. The basic thing, Jack, is just to
get the computer on stand by to save power.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM And we need another battery B readout.
AQUARIUS Okay, he is on his way. Go ahead.

an entry target load.
CAPCOM That's correct. Okay, and then we'll
do - -
SC
There isn't much else they could give
me, is there, Ken?
CAP COM No, not very much. How about IMU power
up according to the GNC checklist 2-1.

Perform the optics power up per page 2-3.
CAP COM That's correct and on panel 229, circuit
breaker timers, main A closed,
SC
Okay. Panel 229, CB timer Main A
closed.
CAP COM That's correct. And the next thing you
will do will be to set the mission timer and what we' ve done
is to only turn on the mission timer on MDC. And you'll
probably have to wait here until they get through with the
uplink so you can have the computer.
SC
Okay. Set it from the CSC, huh?
CAPCOM That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are
getting ready to start the alignment sequence and are you
familiar with the general sequence of events we are going to
use, Jack?
SC
How do you mean. We are going to make
an alignment on the moon and on the sun, other than that -
I didn't get I wasn't on the headset when the general
information was passed up. If there was anymore than that,
I didn't get it.
CAP COM Okay, basically, that is correct. Let
me just run through it hand-weighing type for a minute and then
I'll read you the steps. I think it will make more sense.
Now the scheme is that the LM can fly to set up all angles
that will point your optics at the moon. Now at any time in
any attitude that we happen to be at, if you can look in the
telescope and recognize star patterns sufficient that you
believe that you can make an alignment all on your own, that's
the place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead and
take over with your own alignment. However, we are giving
you a procedure which will give you things we know we can
see in the telescope without worrying about any reflections
or anything of that nature and it's not intended that this
procedure has to be followed past the point where you know

--- PAGE 796 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:11P, GET 116:58:00 569/2
CAP COM you've got good definition of star
patterns in your telescope. If you need to go on, we'll
maneuver, take a look at the moon, we'll take a mark there
and then we'll maneuver with the LM FDAI angles again and
take a look at the sun, and get yourself another mark on
the sun and that will complete the alignment. Now, the
alignment scheme is that we are going to give you a set of
angles that you can course align the ball to when the LM is
pointing you at the moon. Now, this set of angles will agree
with the REFSMMAT that you have in as a nominal REFSMMAT in
your CMC. You can course align to that, set a drift flag
and REFSMMAT flag and you'll have a good platform and we'll
be within a couple of degrees of a good alignment. And, if
we have to, we could break off at this point, then go ahead
with the entry; however, in an attempt to get a good platform
we are going to have you then do a P52 option 1 and what you
are going to find in the option 1 slots is the entry REFSMMAT.
You' 11 come up with the NOUN 22 values and we intend to go
ahead and course align the ball to the entry REFSMMAT attitude
and then we'll go ahead and take marks through a normal P52
sequence. So that's the general scheme that we are going
to use. If you think you have a handle on that, I will go
ahead and read you the steps.
SC
Okay. Well, let me ask a question.
The LM maneuvers to a set moon viewing angles. Okay, at
this time I am going to do a P-52, is that right? With the
planet option?
CAP COM The first thing we are going to do is
to course align the platform and get it inertial based on
the REFSMMAT that you have in the
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 797 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:16P GET 127:03:00 570/1
CAP COM - platform and get his inertial
based on the REFSMMAT that you have in the present slot
inside the CMC. Will then go and do a P-52, option 4.
Correction option 1.
SC
Okay. That's after the LM gets
established at the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the moon
viewing attitude, I do a VE RB 41 NO UN 20 to the set of
angles that you're going to give me at the pass.
CAP COM
That's affirmative.
SC
(garble) of the P-52.
CAP COM
That's correct.
SC
Okay. Then I enter the P-52 and
that's - option 3. Right?
CAP COM The P-52 will be done as an option 1.
The only reason you have the other REFSMMAT inside the
computer is that in order to set the REFSMMAT flag you need
some relative orientation.
SC
Okay. I see. I do a P-52 option 1
and when do I set the REFSMMAT flag and the drift flag?
CAP COM That will before entering P-52. I
am going to give you this procedure in detail.
SC
Okay. All right. Let's go at it.
Maybe it'll all fall out and I won't have any questions. Go
ahead.
CAP COM Okay. I'm ready to start reading again.
We start with a VERB 41 NO UN 20.
SC
Okay. When the LM is at the moon
viewing attitude, I do a VE RB 41 NO UN 20 ENTER.
CAP COM That's right. He'll put in the
attitudes that you'll get from one of the pads and this will
be for the course align angles when the LM is at the moon
viewing attitude. Then when they're all squared away, I tell
you they have the right attitude, we then pick up again with
a VERB 40 NO UN 20 ENTER.
SC
Okay. VE RB 40 NO UN 20 ENTER when
moon is the LM is satisfied that they're at the moon viewing
attitude.
CAP COM That's correct. Now we're going to
set the REFSMMAT and drift flags according to the G&C checklist
page G 7-1 steps 3 and 4.
SC
Okay. Set the REFSMMAT flag for G&C
7-1 steps 3 and 4.
CAP COM That's correct. Now VE RB 37 ENTER 52
ENTER option 1.
SC
VERB 37 ENTER 52 ENTER option 1.
CAP COM That's correct. And we do the course
align.
SC
Okay. Perform the course align.

--- PAGE 798 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:16P GET 127:03:00 570/2
SC
- that box in there.
CAPCOM
Okay. Now when it gets back to the
MARK team we want to take a MARK on the moon.
SC
Okay. MARK on the moon with the
(garble) in the center. Is that right?
CAPCOM
That's affirmative. Okay. When
that's complete, the LM will maneuver to the sun viewing
angle for attitude.
CAPCOM
And when you get there, you take a
MARK on the sun using the sun filter and the telescope and
again we're marking on the center.
SC
Okay. Now, let me ask you a question.
Is the first mark on the moon made with the are all these
made with the telescope and not the sextant?
CAPCOM
If - I'm not sure right off hand
what the angular size of the moon is, Jack. If you can get
it in the sextant that's the best thing to do but you may
have to go into the telescope in order to find the center.
Either one's acceptable.
SC
Okay. If I can define the center
through the sextant, do it that way. And if I can't use
the telescope.
CAPCOM
That's affirmed. We know you're
going to use the telescope on the sun. Okay. You ready
to press on?
SC
I'm ready.
CAPCOM
Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody
a batt B ullage.
SC
Okay. Ullage, volts and amps
coming up.
CAPCOM
All right. Thank you. And this
left us in P052 with two MARKS and we'll go ahead and
torque the NOUN 93's.
SC
Okay. (garble) torque the NOUN 93's.
After the 2 MARKS.
CAPCOM
Okay. So that gives us a good
platform. Now the LM will maneuver to the jettison attitude
and the only thing of significance here is that you want to
watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the
jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform.
SC
Okay. The LM maneuvers to the
jettison attitude and I just monitor the maneuver and yell
at Jim if he gets near a gimbal lock.
CAPCOM
That's affirmed. Okay, and then the
LM will go to a MAX DEADBAND ATTITUDE HOLD and the jettison
attitude.
SC
Okay. The LM goes to MAX DEADBAND
ATTITUDE HOLD.

--- PAGE 799 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-17-60 CST 8:16P GET 127:03:00 570/3
CAP COM Okay. Now we're ready to go back to
work. The next thing we'll do is to continue to power up
procedures. Do you have any further questions on that
alignment Jack?
S C
No. No. I think I think it's
all self explanatory now.
CAP COM Okay. The one thing that everybody
would like for you to understand is we certainly don't
insist on using the moon and the earth if you find you have
good stars, why use them. However, this alignment is more
than adequate to give us a good guided entry.
SC
Okay. If I get a set of good stars,
do I start right out to a basic P-51 attitude - 52 option 1?
CAP COM That's affirmative.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
Okay. Now we're ready to go to work
on panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker main A - -
SC
Wait - wait just a minute. Wait
just
a
minute.
I owe you some volts and amps.
CAP COM
Okay. All right.
SC
Okay. Volts are 39.4 amps 1.25.
CAP COM
Okay. I thought maybe your meter
was stuck before.
SC
No (laughter).
CAP COM All right. You ready to go back to
275? Have a circuit breaker main A. Batt bus A CLOSED.
SC
CB main A batt bus A CLOSED.
CAP COM
That's correct. And circuit breaker
main B batt C CLOSED.
SC
CB main baker batt Charley CLOSED.
CAP COM Okay. That's correct. Now we're
up to EI minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going
to proceed with the closeout and hatch installation.
SC
Okay. Closeout the hatch installation
at EI minus 1 plus 30.
CAP COM That's right Jack and we're going to
close the LM hatch and we'll make the dump valve in the LM
hatch CLOSED.
SC
Understand you're going to close
the dump valve down on the LM hatch right?
CAP COM
That's correct.
SC
Okay. This is a change from what we
had understood previously.
CAP COM
That's correct.
SC
I'm (garble) to see it but that's good.
CAP COM Okay. That's one vote on your side.
Okay. And we're going to go ahead and do the - use the
D cal to perform the hatch installation and we'll start on

--- PAGE 800 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:16P GET 127:03:00 570/4
CAP COM
- the hatch integrity check.
SC
Okay. For the D cal perform the
hatch installation and start on the hatch integrity check.
CAP COM That's correct.
SC
Okay Ken. One thing I think that -
I don't know whether anybody . the D cal don't take into
account the fact that we still have the umbilicals connected
at what point in time should they be removed?
CAP COM Okay Jack. That doesn't matter.
We're going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those
umbilicals and you can leave them right there.
SC
Okay. Does it make any difference
if we disengage - the LM - we have pulled the circuit breakers
LM power 1 and 2 so if we choose to disconnect these umbilicals
there's no alarm. Right?
CAP COM That's right. No sweat.
CAPCOM Joh Ahren just saying that they may
be hot. He's checking on that so how about holding a
decision on that and let me come back to you?
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. And let me tell you what we're
going to do since we told you a different story this afternoon
on this tunnel. We're actually going to vent the tunnel down
so that we end up with about one and a half to two psi
absolute in the tunnel. And this will give us a DELTA P of
3. So we'll do our hatch integrity check at the same time
we're venting the tunnel now.
SC
Okay. It sounds good.
CAP COM Okay. Now let me give you some
plumbing switches here. Let's take the search tank oxygen
valve to ON.
SC
Search tank 02 to ON.
CAP COM
All right. Take the main regs 2 OPEN.
SC
Main REGs 2 to OPEN.

AQUARIUS Okay, there's those four circuit breakers
over there Ken, when you said panel 8 that's what I thought
you were talking about. I don't think the circuit breakers
are out right now but why don't we just put verify the
circuit breakers and put the switches to main A main B.
CAP COM Okay, that's correct Jack. Okay, at
EI minus one hour we're going to be doing the LM jettison, so
just prior to that we'll do a P47.
AQUARIUS Ok ay say in about one minute to LM
jettison, huh?
CAP COM Yes, just something that's comfortable
for you.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM Alright, after we've done that, we want
to get panel 8 sequential pyro arm two of them on.
AQUARIUS Okay, I get a go for (garbled)
CAP COM
Okay, John says we can watch it.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM Alright the next thing is CSM LM final
SEP two of them on up.
AQUARIUS CSM LM final SEP two on.
CAP COM That's correct. Now we're going back
to panel 8 and it's sequential pyro alarm two of them to
safe.
AQUARIUS Okay, that's pyro alarm two to safe.
CAP COM That's correct and go back to P00.
AQUARIUS Okay, go to P00.
CAP COM Alright, and now it's time to configure
for single ring.
AQUARIUS Okay, configure for single ring RCS.
CAP COM That's right and since you're still an
hour from EI I guess it wouldn't hurt to use metal lead
balls or something like that rather than adapt or at least
not till you get closer down. We'll have the DAP lights
for you later.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM Okay and as soon as you've gotten your-
self all set up with a good control mode, you want to maneuver
to the reentry attitude.
AQUARIUS Maneuver to entry attitude per to DAP
CAP COM That's correct. And we show EI minus
55 and which really means when you get to the entry attitude
we have a sextant star check for you. And that will be on
the pad.
AQUARIUS Okay, perform a sextant star check.
CAP COM Okay, and I want to remind you to part
the optics at 93 of shaft.
AQUARIUS Okay, say again why Ken, I didn't understand
that.
CAP COM Okay, this is just a precaution Jack.
If we part the optics with a 90 degree shaft angle that will

--- PAGE 803 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:29 GET 127:16:00 571/3
CAP COM align up the slits SO it gives you
the best air flow over that part of the heat shield and
avoids a hot spot. If you don't remember it, I don't think
it makes much difference. Just good procedure.
AQUARIUS Okay.
CAP COM Okay, and after you've got it parked
where ever you want it, we'll turn the optic power off and
stow the optics.
AQUARIUS Okay, optics power off, stow the optics.
CAP COM Okay, that's good. Okay, the next
thing we'll do is initialize the EMF and that's on entry
checklist page 2-1 step number 2.
AQUARIUS Okay, perform EMF initialization on
entry checklist on page 2-1 step 2.
CAP COM Okay, that's correct. Now we're
coming up on EI minus 45 minutes, and we'll give you an
entry pad and a final state vector.
AQUARIUS Okay, at minus 45 entry pad and final
state vector for MSFN.
CAP COM Okay, now we're going to perform
what we call the moon check. Rather than go into detail,
if you already know what we're doing, just say so, otherwise
I'll describe the use of the moon attitude sensor.
AQUARIUS I think you better describe it.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. You remember everybody
in the past has commented on seeing moon set just a couple
minutes prior to EI, and you're horizon will probably be
dark at the time that you get there you're having an
early morning entry and coming in from the west you'll
still be looking at a dark horizon. So, just as a back up
technique just like you would track the horizon, we're going
to give you an attitude which will be on the pad so that
you can look directly at the moon. This is an enertial
attitude. It won't be changing and you'll put the 36
degree window line on the moon and just sit there and
watch it and just prior to EI the earth will come up and
you will then have a good horizon check. And I have some
times, and I'll give you that later. And if you just
look at this thing now, at that point you can set the GDC
or whatever you desire. And you will have a known attitude
reference. It's just like a horizon check.
AQUARIUS Okay, I maneuver to the moon check
attitude at which time I put the 36 window line on the
moon and just prior

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:43P GET 127:30 572/1
SC
- I maneuver to the Moon check attitude, at
which time I put the 36th window aline on the Moon and just
prior to TEI the Earth will (garble).
CAP COM That's correct. And that corresponds to the
same inertial attitude that you'd have on the back of your
entry card where it shows the horizon attitude several min-
utes prior to EI, it's the same thing.
SC
Yes, S-BAND one at 17 minutes prior. Okay.
CAP COM Okay, and we're just getting it in a little
closer. Okay, the next item on the check
SC
(Garble).
CAP COM - checklist here is an EI minus 40; we're
going to panel 7; and it's BMAG number 2 power to WARMUP.
SC
Okay, panel 7, BMAG number 2 power to WARMUP.
CAP COM That's correct. Now, I'd like to verify the
surge tank and repress packages are ON.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 127 hours, 31 min-
utes. We've completed the shift handover in Mission Control.
A change of shift briefing is scheduled to begin in about
15 minutes at 9 P.M. in the main News Center Auditorium, in
Building 1 -
CAP COM - control system; waste water, urine dumped
heater, two of them, CLOSED.
SC
Panel 5, CB ECS (garble) fuel, urine dump
heaters, 2 to CLOSE.
CAP COM That's correct. Suit compressor number 2 to
OFF.
SC
Suit compressor 2 to OFF.
CAP COM That's right, Jack, and what this what we're
planning to do in order to conserve power is we're going to
run the suit compressor from an hour to this point at the
minus 40. And we'll be watching the PC02, if that thing's
working we'll turn it off at the earliest time that we have
a good cabin, and then we'll just leave it off. And in the
event that the PC02 gage isn't working properly or something
like that - well, we'll just go ahead and run it for this
time frame.
SC
Okay, that sounds good.
CAP COM All right, now, we're at EI minus 30. Sequen-
cial logic, that's two of them to ON.
SC
EI minus 30; SEQ logic two ON.
CAP COM
Okay, in panel 7 the BMAG number 2 power to
ON.
SC
Okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for
the warmup, huh?
CAP COM
That's okay.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
All right, and the FDAI power to BOTH.
SC
FDAI power to BOTH.
CAP COM
Okay. And we want to activate the primary
evaporator.

--- PAGE 805 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:43P GET 127:30 572/2
SC
Okay, activate the primary evaporator. All
this time, Ken, what we've been getting is our cooling. Right
now I think we have the radiators at PULL to BYPASS.
CAP COM That's correct. We started out that way, and
we turned the glycol pumps on, and we're just circulating it
internally. And, we're counting on the command module being
a heat sink, it's pretty cold soaked, and it looks like this
is good enough. You got some relatively low heat loads -
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
- and we'll keep watching the TEMPS, and if
we need it, why we'll start the evaporatory early.
SC
Okay, that sounds good.
CAP COM
Do you believe it's cold up there?
SC
Yes, and we used to call the command module
the bedroom, and it's now the refrigerator.
CAP COM Okay, just don't call it the refer.
CAP COM Okay, at about EI minus 19 we get back into
the standard entry checklist on page 2 dash 2, where it
starts with P61.
SC
Okay, at EI minus 19 we get back into the
entry checklist at page 2 dash 2; where we start entering
P61.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. Now that's the - those are the
timeline note I had for you. I hate to tell you this, but
I also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry
checklist. They aren't corrections, they just are pieces of
the entry checklist which will correspond to what I've writ -
already read to you. And I'm ready to go on that whenever
you are. And, Vance tells me you can get into the descent
water for drinking now.
SC
We can get into the descent water for drink-
ing, huh?
CAP COM
Un-huh.
SC
Sounds good.
CAP COM
Hey, go to it.
SC
Jim would like to know whether the descent
water will be good until LM jettison?
CAP COM Okay, Jack. Looks like we're going to go
on the ascent tanks at 128:30. And it looks like -
SC
(Garble) S-BAND -
CAP COM
- you have plenty of water. I'm sorry we
cut each other out, say again.
SC
Okay, yes, I was going to say, understand
we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30.
CAP COM That's right, based on the current rate that's
what they predict and you can go ahead and drink the water.
No sweat.
SC
Okay, real fine.
SC
And I've got the entry checklist down, and
I'm ready to copy just give me the page.

--- PAGE 806 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:43P GET 127:30 572/3
CAPCOM Okay. Jack, you're starting to sound like
an LMP.
SC
I think I'm probably the only CMP that's
ever witnessed an - a LM burn from inside the LM in - in
spaceflights.
CAP COM (Laughter) I hope it stays that way. Okay,
Jack we're starting on page 1 dash 1.
SC
Okay, go ahead.
CAP COM
Okay, down in the middle of the page on line
9, we're just going to strike out the activate the vhf for
COMM check, and line 10 verify the DSE. We're going to leave
the DSE off, and that's to save power as is the VHF activa-
tion.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
Okay, on page 1 dash 2. At minus 2 hours
there's a title logic sequence check; and we're deleting
that entire sequence; that's included in what I read up to
you.
SC
Okay, delete the logic sequence check at
minus 2 hours there.
CAP COM That's correct. And delete lines 23, 24, and
25; that means a maneuver to super CIRC entry attitude,
everything below that is deleted.
SC
Okay, delete lines 23 through 28.
CAP COM
That's correct, you got ahead of me. All
right on line 29 on page 1 dash 3 we're going to put in a
time of minus 00:55, that's the time we gave you for the
boresight check.
SC
Ok ay
CAP COM
It's a sextant check, really.
SC
I got that.
CAP COM Okay, on the top of page 1 dash 4; where it
said 1 hour and 15 minutes next to line 32, we're going to
change that to minus 2 hours and 30 minutes.
SC
Okay, minus 2:30 opposite item 32.
CAP COM Okay, down at the bottom of the EMS entry
check, right there where we are, the bottom line now reads:
EMS mode to STANDBY. Well, just above that like to remind
you to put our mark, do not initialize the range to go. This
is because you're going to come into the EMS entry check,
you're going to run through all these things, then we're
going to remove power from the EMS. And, just didn't want
you to get ahead of yourself and initialize the entry para-
meters cause you'll lose them when we power up.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
And, after we go EMS mode to STANDBY, like
for you to add circuit breaker EMS 2 to OPEN.
SC
Okay, CB EMS 2 to OPEN.
CAP COM
That's correct.
CAP COM And we want to delete this setup camera

--- PAGE 807 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:43P GET 127:30 572/4
CAP COM - that's listed on the bottom of the page;
we're deleting that for power reasons. That's line 33 Alfa.
SC
Okay, we're way ahead of you. We already
got it stowed.
CAP COM Okay. On the top of the next page where it
says secondary water evap; just keep in mind we don't plan to
use the secondary evaporators unless the primary fails. On
line 35 on page 1 dash 5; next to command module RCS preheat,
the time is now minus 6:30.
SC
Okay, minus 6:30 and the voltage reading
3.9 still is good, right?
CAP COM Okay, very good. Under final stowage the
first thing that's listed on line 36 page 1 dash 5 is optics.
And, if you want to get started on your stowage we'd like
to leave the optics out, because we'll have the star check
coming up quite a bit after this. The rest of that stuff
can be taken care of at your convenience.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM All right, still on page 1 dash 5, line 37;
the time is now minus 6:10 -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 808 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:55P GET 127:42:00 573/1
SC
Got that?
CAP COM And this is one time it looks like
we might actually do the preheat so that's the reason we
want to make sure that we know that not more than 20 minutes
of time on the preheat.
CAP COM We may not be able to watch it at
that time because you are powered up.
SC
Okay. Either 20 minutes or till
3.9 volts DC.
CAP COM That's correct Jack. And now lets
go to page 1-6. And about 1/3 of the way down shows panel
275 CB main batt C CLOSED. We want to strike off that line,
the next two lines and we're going to strike out main A
batt C CLOSED. Main B batt C CLOSED, and DC indicator
main B.
SC
Okay. After that step on panel
275, strike out CB main A batt C; CB main batt C; and DC
indicators to main B.
CAP COM That's correct. Now under panel 8,
it tells you to close all circuit breakers except and I have
4 additions. The first one is CB service module; RCS heaters;
QUAD Charley main B OPEN.
SC
Service module RCS heaters, QUAD
Charley, main Baker OPEN.
CAP COM Okay. And the same thing for service
module RCS heaters QUAD DELTA main A OPEN.
SC
Service module RCS heaters QUAD
DELTA main A OPEN.
CAP COM That's correct. And circuit breaker
EMS. That's 2 of them, OPEN.
SC
CB EMS 2 to OPEN.
CAP COM All right. And the last is a circuit
breakers for SPS gaging, four of them OPEN.
SC
SPS gaging, four at OPEN.
CAP COM Okay. And how about a readout on
the battery and a charger?
SC
Okay. (garble)
CAP COM That's affirmed. Well, lets go back
to page 1-6, line 41. Lets put in a time minus 440.
SC
Minus 440.
CAP COM That's correct. On page 2-1. Line
number 2, put in a time of minus 55 minutes.
SC
Okay. Minus 55 minutes.
CAP COM Okay. And the first thing you want
to do under EMS initialization is circuit breakers EMS,
thats two of them, to CLOSE.

--- PAGE 809 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:55P GET 127:42:00 573/2
SC
- CB EMS 2 to CLOSE.
CAPCOM That's correct. All right. Line
4 or step 4 where it shows CM RCS check. That occurs at
minus 430.
SC
Okay. Minus 430.
CAP COM All right. Under CM RCS checks,
the fourth line down says manual attitude 3 to minimal
impulse. We'll have to use excel command and the reason
for that Jack is we don't have the SCS powered up so there's
no impulse generator.
SC
okay. Manual attitude, 3 to self
command.
CAPCOM That's correct. And on the same
page 2-1, strike out the last 3 lines starting with RCS
transfer to service module.
SC
Right. The last three lines are
scratched out. We ain't got one of those pages.
CAP COM That's correct. Okay, lets flip to
page 2-2 and strike out the first 2 lines.
SC
Okay. Now wait a second I need to
give you volts and amps again.
CAP COM
All right. Go ahead.
SC
Okay. It's 39.6 1.12.
CAPCOM
Sounds like you're getting there.
CAP COM Okay. I believe we scratched out
the first 2 lines on 2-2. Now we're right below that it
says separation checklist. So we're going to just delete
that whole thing that included in the notes I gave you.
SC
Okay. Its clear to delete notations.
CAP COM All right. Line number 7. It says
maneuver to horizon check attitude. We're going to call
this the moon check attitude and this is the one we discussed
Jack. The angle of 265 is not correct. I'll have one of
those for you first thing in the morning.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. And at the bottom of the page,
step number 1. That will be after EI minus 19 minutes and
we're off and running through a normal sequence of events.
SC
Okay. That sounds good.
SC
Ken. I guess you've read this thing.
Is it a comfortable timeline? Any areas where you had
problems with?
CAP COM Jack, it is very comfortable. We
run it several times now and fact is it's being run right
now again. And we run it both here at Houston and the Cape.
The only place where you might find that you need to stay
ahead of things is during the platform alignment period when

--- PAGE 810 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:55P GET 127:42:00 573/3
CAP COM you're getting ready to close out the
LM and then once you get into the command module and jettison
the LM why you're back on a very comfortable time. And,
of course, we'll be watching and anything we can do, like
keeping track of time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go
along.
SC
Hey, that would be good - that would
be good, Ken.
CAP COM Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that
2-1/2 hours is the earliest time we can start in on that power
up and stuff. Everything else you can do the way you normally
would where you get as far ahead of the game as you can. But
the 2-1/2 hour time is based on saving command module consum-
ables. And if you do that while we're fat, we've got plenty
of time to give you some fans on the water even. So that's
the one point you don't want to start early on. I do have
a couple of more lines to run through on the entry checklist
and two pages in the G&C. And I think that will clean us up.
SC
Okay, Ken, and G&C checklist now?
CAP COM Let me finish a couple more things
in the entry book. You still got that?
SC
Yes. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. On - these are just clean-up
items, Jack. On page 2-3, it lists how you separate from
the CM/SM sep and all that SO obviously we're on step 5 and
43 minutes down - that's all deleted. And that gets deleted
all the way over onto page 2-4 up to the line where it says
50 minutes. And at that point, we pick backup and everything.
from 15 minutes down is valid.
SC
Okay. Delete item 5 down to the
point where it says minus 15 minutes.
CAP COM That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page
2-5. The top line where we had horizon check, that's now
the moon set check and the time is approximately 57:37.
And that's minus 223. And that angle that's listed in the book
there 177 that's really a horizon time. In two minutes
we'll have you you can look that up on the back of your
entry cue card and I'll look that number up again for you
tonight.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Okay. Another thing is to remember
when we begin blackout, which is around 05 g and you can
write this in your checklist wherever it's convenient, once
we've lost comm we're going to go ahead and power down the
S CE power off and the PMP power off. And we just want to
do that after you lose comm, which comes up aroun TI. Any
time after that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the SCE
power.

--- PAGE 811 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 8:55P GET 127:42:00 573/4
SC
Okay. When comm is locked, SCE power
off, PMP power off.
CAP COM That's correct, Jack, and that completes
the entry checklist. Let's look at the G&C book.
SC
Okay. Ready to copy.
CAP COM
Okay. Let's go to page 2-1.
SC
Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. The second line under
IMU power up, says FDAI power to both and we're going to
make that a 1. The reason we're doing that is again to
conserve power. There's no reason to drive the second FDAI
before we get that information to put on it.
SC
Okay. FDAI power to 1.
CAP COM
All right. That's correct. On page
2-2.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. Under CMC power up, line
step 2 says flashing 3700 enter. The time we're going to
use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just brought the
computer up and it has a state vector in it that's way back
many, many hours ago. So we want to do a VE RB 96 enter to
stop the integration to keep it from just sitting there
ambling along. And when the ground gives you a new state
vector, why then we can go through P00 and we'll be back in
business.
SC
Okay. You want me to go to VERB 37
enter 000 enter and then do VERB 96?
CAP COM When you come up, I guess you're
going to - once you get the CMC powered up, you're probably
going to be going - you're going to come up in a flashing
37 and if you'll just do a VE RB 96 enter right there, that
will take care of it.
SC
Okay.
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 812 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 9:08P GET 127:55:00 574/1
CAP COM - 37 and if you will just do a VE RB 96
ENTER right there, that will take care of it.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM All right. And the last one I have
for you is on page 2-4.
SC
Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay. Under the SCS power up, the first
line says AUTO RCS select 16 OFF. Okay. You can just delete
that part. On the fifth line it says circuit breaker SCS
logic power, that's really logic bus, four of them to closed.
The DELTA V CG is not important since we are not burning the
engine. The signal condition driver bias power lists 2 to
AC-1. We are going to make that just 1 of them, make it
signal condition driver bias power 1 to AC 1. The B mag
power which is the 3rd line from the bottom says B mag power
2 ON, we are going to make that just 1. We'll bring up
number 1 and we'll make FDI power number 1 and the last line
AUTO RCS select 16 and able, you can strike that off and
replace it with B mag mode 3 of them to rate 1. You want
to try reading that back?
SC
Okay. Delete RCS select 26 OFF. Change
CB logic power to logic thrust power, CBS CS logic thrust
4 to closed, delete DELTA V CG, coming down here signal
conditioner driver power 1, AC 1, C mag power 1 to ON, and
it's the number 1 B mag, ACA power to 1, d mag mode 33 to
rate 1, deleting the AUTO RCS select 16 to ENABLE.
CAP COM That's correct. You've got them all
Jack. Thank you.
SC
Thank you. This does it, huh?
CAP COM Yes, Sir. Let's see. Just let me
check on this hatch and integrity check, maybe I can tell you
something about that. And I do have an answer to your LM
power question about the umbilicals. The umbilicals will
be unpowered according to the LM procedures, SO if you'd like
to disconnect them, you can.
SC
Okay. I think we will.
CAP COM All right, Sir. Okay, Jack, they'd
like us to stand by for just a second.
CAP COM Jack, would you get the battery charger
off, please.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
and we'll finish the rest of that
procedure later.
SC
You mean there's more? Okay. battery
charger is going off.
CAP COM
Right.

--- PAGE 813 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4-16-70 CST 9:08P GET 127:55:00 574/2
SC
Okay, Vance, Okay. I don't think
you've given me the back out procedure, have you, for the
battery chargers?
CAP COM That's negative. Wait. All we want to
do, Jack, is say battery charge off at the moment. We'll
complete that procedure as soon as you are through with
Ken completely.
SC
Okay, Vance, the battery chargers OFF
and I'm ready to continue with Ken.
CAP COM Okay, Jack, and we'll get the back out
to you after that.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed
up the loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all that
stuff, it looks like we generated only one question on the
floor and we'll research that one. We'll even let you guess
what it might have been. If you have any questions, after
you mull it over, why, we're always available. Just ask just
what you're thinking about.
SC
Okay. That's what we're going to do.
We're going to wait until the LM people get theirs and we're
going to discuss it for these things here, and we're going
to make sure that we don't have any interface problems. If
we have any more questions, we'll be coming back at you.
CAP COM Okay, we did run the thing integrated
so we think that we've got all the little surprises ironed
out for you.
SC
I hope so because tomorrow is examination
time.
CAP COM
Roger.
SC
Ken, this is Jim.
CAP COM
Yes sir.
SC
Appreciate the work that you've done,
and Jack says that it's going to be hard to beat his record
about saving SM RCS fuel all the way there and back.
CAP COM I can't do much about that. Some people
will do anything to set a record.
CAP COM Hey, Jim, you even did good on Service
Module fuel this time.
SC
Yes, we're coming back with a full load
almost of both RCS and SCS. That's pretty much of a record.
Okay, did you want to put Fred-0 on or somebody to copy the
LM data out?
CAP COM Hey, Jack, don't wake him up yet. Standby
one.
SC
He's awake.
CAP COM Hey, Jack, we'll give you this Battery
charging backout procedure and then Deke says you ought to

--- PAGE 814 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 9:08P, GET 127:55:00, 574/3
CAP COM - get some sleep. You're going to
need it tomorrow.
SC
Okay. I'm ready to copy the back out
procedures.
CAP COM Okay. Panel 3, Battery Charge - OFF.
You've already done that, Jack. Next AC inverter, inverter
to OFF. Panel 5, Main Bus Tie Batt B/C to Batt B/C. Yes,
it's the UP position. Panel 250, Circuit Breaker, Batt A
Power entry/Post landing to OPEN. Circuit Breaker, Batt B
Power entry/Post Landing - OPEN. Panel 5, CB Battery Charger
Batt B Charge OPEN. Okay, I let you read that back, Jack.
SC
Okay, Batt Charge - OFF. AC inverter
to - OFF. Main Bus Tie, Batt B/C to ON - Up. Panel 250,
CB Batt A Power entry/Post landing Open. CB, Batt B,
Power entry/Post landing OPEN. Panel 5, CB Batt Charger
Batt B - Charged - OPEN.
CAP COM Okay. That's correct. That gets you
back to the place where you can back out of the big battery
charging procedure, which you have. I think you have the
back out procedure for that, but I'd like to check with you.
SC
Okay, standby here.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. Do you have that back out
procedure in your hands.
SC
Yes, I do, Vance.
CAP COM Okay, just to verify. It starts out
Panel 3, Battery Charge Switch - OFF. AC inverter 2 - OFF.
Panel 5, Main Bus Tie, Batt A/C ON/UP, etc.
SC
Roger. Continue, CB Batt A Power entry/
Post landing OPEN. Inverter Power 2, Main B OPEN, and
then you reverse the steps that you had for entering the
procedures.
CAPCOM Yes. That's fine. Okay, and we have
one other comment regarding this systems checklist, and
standby one and that'll wrap it up for US. A new item came
in, Jack. We need to switch to Ascent water, and I have a
three step procedure for you, if you're ready to copy.
SC
Okay. Jim will copy that.
CAP COM Okay. Descent water valve CLOSE.
Ascent water valve to CLOSE. Water tank select valve to
Ascent.
SC
Okay, Vance. Descent water valve
CLOSE, Ascent water valve CLOSE, and Water select tank
to Ascent. Is that correct?
CAP COM Water tank select ASCENT. That's
correct, Jim.
SC
And we'll proceed with that right now,
and how about us still drinking descent water?

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 9:08P, GET 127:55:00, 574/4
CAP COM Jim, we understand that you should be
able to continue drinking it.
SC
Okay, we switched to ascent water, but
we'll probably have to have the descent water valve back
opened up again to drink water.
CAP COM That's affirmative. That's the one
thing you'll have to do is whenever you want a drink -
END OF TAPE

--- PAGE 816 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 9:21P, GET 128:08:00, 575/1
CAP COM That's affirm. That's the one thing
that you'll have to do is whenever you want to drink out
of the descent tank is open the descent valve. The descent
water valve momentarily will have to be opened.
SC
Okay. We are now on ascent water.
CAP COM Okay. I need Jack again, please.
SC
Okay, Vance. I'm here and you have
something with the systems checklist.
CAP COM That's right. Referred to S2-6.
This really what we're talking about, Jack is the hatch
integrity check decal. I think that it'll be easiest if
you'll open to S2-6 and I'll explain it to you.
SC
Okay, Vance. I'm ready to copy.
CAPCOM Okay. This just involves changes.
Look down to the third line where it says tunnel vent valve -
tunnel vent for 30 seconds. Cross out 30 seconds and cross
out the 2 lines below that. In other words, LM CSM DELTA-P,
Check DELTA-P and cycle to tunnel vent.
SC
Okay. You want me to delete for 30
seconds.
CAP COM That's affirmative, and the 2 lines
below 30 seconds. Actually a part of the fourth line there,
which is 8 1/2 minutes, too.
SC
Standby. Can you read okay?
CAPCOM Yes. I hear you now. Okay, delete
the 2 lines below that or the 2 1/2 lines below that also.
CAP COM That's affirm, and now we have an
addition to put in place of what we deleted. Standby one.
The Comm is bad. How do you read?
SC
Now it's loud and clear.
CAP COM Okay. We want you to vent - tunnel
vent until, and add the following, until LM/CM DELTA-P is
equal to 3.0 psid.
SC
Okay, until LM/CM DELTA-P equals 3.0.
CAP COM Okay, and that means that you'll have
a pressure of 1.5 to 2 in the tunnel absolute. That's a note.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM Jack, we've got something that we want
to end up with ultimately is 1 1/2 to 2 in that tunnel depending
on the gauge reading, but that should be about 3.
SC
Okay, Deke.
CAP COM Okay, then Jack, continuing on, every-
thing is okay until you get down to on the next page, you
get through verify 02 flow indicator no increase. We would
like to delete everything below that until the last step
which is tunnel lights OFF. So starting with the 4 undocking
only, delete all lines through tunnel vent valve tunnel vent.

--- PAGE 817 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 9:21, GET 128:08:00, 575/2
SC
Okay, delete the section that says
before undocking only down until where it says tunnel
vent valve to tunnel vent.
CAP COM
Yes, through that.
SC
Well, through that. Leave tunnel lights
off is the only step remaining.
CAP COM
Roger, and just - that's a verify.
SC
Okay. Got that.
CAP COM
Okay, really what this does for you
then is it gives you a pressure a tunnel pressure integrity
or a hatch pressure integrity check with a DELTA-P of 3
psi between the tunnel and the cabin. And, then you never go on
to the steps of venting that on out. You just leave it in
there for the time that you separate from the LM. That gives
you a shotgun DELTA-V effect.
SC
Okay. Copy that.
CAP COM Okay, I think that's all, but we're
polling the house here to see if there's another comment
for you. Standby.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Vance.
CAPCOM Jack, that's it. Unless you have
any more questions, why, everyone is hoping you'll hit the
sack and get some rest.
SC
Okay. You want that Battery backout
procedure now. To that - to complete the remaining step?
CAP COM That's affirm, Jack. We request
that you go ahead and finish out the backout completely until
you get to square 1. Over.
SC
Okay.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Jim.
SC
Do you have any more updates for us?
CAP COM
We've still got a LM update, but we
strongly recommend that you and Jack work as hard as you
can sleeping for about the next 5 hours. Fred can handle
it.
SC
Okay, that's what we'll do. We'll put
Fred on watch here, and Jack and I will take it easy and
if Fred copies the LM update, well, then we'll all start
from fresh in the morning.
CAP COM
You bet.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
SC
Go ahead, Vance.
CAP COM
Okay, Fred, two or three things. First,
thing is we need a docking angle checked as soon as you
can conveniently get it. Second point, please drink all the

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 9:21P, GET 128:08:00, 575/3
CAP COM - descent stage water you want. That
wasn't clear before, and the third point, if you have a piece
of paper, standby to get writer's cramps. We have something
to give you here.
SC
Okay. You want a general look at the
docking tunnel index.
CAP COM Why don't you go ahead and look at
that - look at that first, yes.
SC
Okay.
PAO
This is Apollo Control at 128 hours
SC
Jim says the docking tunnel index
a plus 2.1 degrees.
CAP COM Okay. Plus 2.1 degrees, docking tunnel
index.
SC
Okay. He corrects himself. He says
make that sign a minus. Minus 2.1 degrees.
CAPCOM Okay, we just changed, plus to minus.
SC
Okay, and your second item was we
could drink all of that descent water that's left - looks
like about 5 percent, and I'll get a book here and be ready
to start writing.
CAP COM Okay. Get - this won't be as long as
the one T. K. read up, but you'll need several pages, probably.
SC
Okay, I've got lots of pages here of
Ken's photo log. I'm set to go.

SC
just the essential things required
to make a safe left jettison? We're at - I don't think we
have the time to really do any engineering data and people
might want to look at it as the thing goes into the atmosphere.
CAP COM Well, Jim. I think that that was what
everybody aimed for and people down here feel that's it's
the essential. That it's what you need.
SC
Well, we'll do everything you think
is essential, but I just don't want to be slow on switches
at the last minute. What we're really thinking about getting
that command module in good shape.
CAP COM Hey, Jim, this is Tom. The only
reason we're bringing up the PNGS is to have another reference
system just to have control of the LM as you jettison. Over.
SC
Okay. Okay, Tom. It's - I thought
the value of that hold was insufficient for this when we
first thought about this.
CAP COM Yes. I agree. But they decided just
in case we have any blitz with the AGS, we want to make sure
we get that LM off in good shape. And I agree with you on
keeping out all the garbage on it.
SC
Okay, Tom.

from CM-LM umbilical. We'll let you turn to that.
SC
Okay, I'm there at EI minus 2 1/2 hours,
power removal CM-LM umbilical.
CAP COM Okay. Under LM, we have a step Bat to
low voltage off reset then on. Next we have a step Bat to
high voltage off reset then on. We request that you wait
in between these two steps for us to give you a go. In other
words, we'd like to look and see that all the relays closed
and all that sort of thing before you throw Bat 2 high voltage

All right, go ahead Vance.
CAP COM Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out
all this stuff with a couple of exceptions. Forward dump valve
closed, the first step should remain. All other steps should
be scratched except for the last one which is over head dump
valve closed. That leaves two steps.
SC
Okay, under ECS we delete all except the
first step forward dump valve closed, and step 10 which is
overhead dump valve closed, and leave in verb (Garbled)
transfer list.
CAP COM That's affirm. Leave in what follows,
which is verified transfer lists and IVT and all that. IVT
of course, meaning CDR transferring to the CM.
SC
We wouldn't forget it.
CAP COM Okay Fred-o, that's the changes, not quite
as extensive as the CSM had but still pretty long. Any comments
or questions for the house here?
SC
No. It looks pretty good to me Vance.
CAP COM Okay. Very good. Oh, and the other comment
aside from the checklist, we've been watching your descent stage
water and it looks - or your ascent water and it looks real
good.
SC
Okay.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 129 hours
43 minutes. Recounting events since the change of shift
about 3 hours ago. We've completed passing up to the crew
checklists for both the Command and Service Module and the
Lunar Module - entry checklist, at about 128 hours 30
minutes, we had the crew switch over from the descent water
tanks which were down to about 5 percent to the LM ascent
stage water tank for cooling. We instructed the crew that
they could drink all the water from the descent tank. At
about 127 hours, 59 minutes, the Battery charging was terminated.
This had been accomplised by using power from the LM batteries
and using that to charge the Command Module entry batteries
two of the three CM entry batteries. At the present time,
Fred Haise is on watch, and Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert are
scheduled for about 5 hours rest. We're also planning to
place a minimum of calls to the spacecraft to allow Fred
Haise to get a bit of rest also, at this time. Flight Dynamics
Officer, and the Retro Officer - the Return to Earth Officer have
currently predicted that our entry interface angle will be
minus 6.03 degrees without a mid-course correction. We're
presently planning for a mid-course correction Mid-course
correction 7 which would be 5 hours prior to entry interface.
As it looks right now, this mid-course correction would be
quite small to put us on the desired flight path angle of
about 6 1/2 degrees-negative 6 1/2 degrees interface angle.
To accomplish this, it looks as if we'll have about a 2.8
second - 2.8 foot per second burn with the Lunar Module
reaction control system thrusters. This would require about

--- PAGE 833 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/16/70, CST 10:46P, GET 129:33:00, 581/2
P AO
- about 21 seconds of thrusting. During
the course of the evening, both Deke Slayton and Tom Stafford
have been standing by the CAP COM console. Occasionally
interjecting a comment. At one point, while Fred Haise was
receiving a Lunar Module entry checklist, with a hot mike,
with his mike open, we heard a comment from Lovell which
prompted a remark from Deke Slayton to the effect that he
would play up some guitar music if they thought that would
soothe Lovell into getting a bit of rest. Ken Mattingly has
also been here a good part of the evening. We don't see him
at the console at this time. Our Capsule Communicator up
until just a few minutes ago was Astronaut Vance Brand and
he has since turned over those duties to Astronaut Jack
Lousma. At 129 hours 46 minutes, Apollo 13 is 87 684
nautical miles - correction 74 900 nautical miles from the
Earth, and travelling at a speed of 6 999 feet per second.
All of the consumables aboard the LM remain in good shape
at this time. We had Fred Haise remove the LM power amplifier
and in effect reduce the effective power output - radio
frequency power output from the LM from about 20 watts to about
1 watt, which is the normal powered down configuration we've
been in with the LM for communications. We expect it will
as it has in the past give us periods of noisy communications
as the LM antennas rotate through the so-called null areas.
Where the signal to noise ratio drops off - we get a high noise
level and this will persist until the spacecraft rotates through
to where we have good lockup on the LM antenna, and again
at 129 hours 47 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 130 hours 36 minutes.
The Flight Dynamics Officer just reported that continued
tracking data shows the spacecraft to be within the entry
corridor still at about the same entry interface angle as
previously reported. The tracking at this time shows that
our entry interface angle remains at about minus 6.03 degrees.
The midcourse correction plan for 5 hours prior to reentry
which will be about 7 hours 3 minutes from now. It is planned
at this time to be 2.81 feet per second. That would be about
a 21 second burn with the spacecraft, the LM reaction control
system thrusters. In about an hour, Flight Director Milton
Windler plans to go over once again with the flight controllers
all of the step by step procedures which the crew will be
following tomorrow prior to entry while with the command and
service module. At the present time Apollo 13 is 71 483 nautical
miles from the Earth. Traveling at a speed of 7192 feet per
second. All of our consumables on the LM remain unchanged.
We're in good shape on water, battery power, and lithium
hydroxide. The present level of carbon dioxide as measured
in the spacecraft telemetered back to the ground is about
.4 of a millimeter of mercury which is very good. We're
showing a total average current on the LM, at this time, of
between 10 and 12 amps, which has been the normal amount
we've been running in the powered down mode with the lunar
module. At the present time, all 3 of the astronauts are
apparently resting. Astronauts Lovell and Swigert were to
have begun a rest period at about 128 hours 17 minutes. We
did hear once or twice Jim Lovell after that period. At the
129 hours 39 minutes or about 1 hours ago, we completed
passing the lunar module a preentry checklist up to Fred Haise
and advised him that we would keep communications to a minimum,
and hoped he would be able to get a little rest also. At
130 hours 39 minutes this is Mission Control, Houston.

This is Apollo Control at 131 hours
14 minutes. Our last conversation with the spacecraft came
at about 129 hours 39 minutes, a little more than an hour
and a half ago. Since that time it's been relatively quiet
here in Mission Control. Within the next hour, flight
director Milton Windler plans for review again the procedures
to be followed during the reentry with each of the flight
controllers. These entry procedures were passed up to the
crew, prior to the time they began their rest period. At
this time we presume that all three crewmen aboard the
spacecraft are resting. At the present time we show Apollo 13
to be 68 857 nautical miles from the earth. The velocity
increase now up to 7346 feet per second and increasing ever
more rapidly as the spacecraft nears earth. We're now
6 hours 25 minutes from the scheduled midcourse correction
which will put Apollo 13 in the center of the entry corridor.
And we're 11 hours 25 minutes from the beginning of reentry.
At 131 hours 16 minutes, this is Mission Control, Houston.

mid-course correction maneuver, mid-course correction 7,
which is targeted to put Apollo 13 in the center of the
reentry corridor. Our last communications with the spacecraft
was at 129 hours 39 minutes when we completed passing up the
Lunar Module pre-entry checklist to Fred Haise, and we presume
that all three of the crewmen have been resting or at least
relaxing since that time. At 128 hours 17 minutes or about
3 1/2 hours ago Fred Haise and - rather Jack Swigert and
Jim Lovell were scheduled to begin a rest period. Although,
we did hear from Jim Lovell once or twice, after that time,
we have not heard from Jack Swigert since the rest period
began. At 131 hours 49 minutes, this is Mission Control

SC
Okay.
SC
Okay. You ought to have it now, Jack.
CAP COM
Okay. You're coming through good
now, Fred. I've got three DELTA's to the checklist. They're
minor changes. I'd like to pass them along now. One of
them is to the CSM checklist. So if you'll pick that up,
I'll give it to you.
SC
Okay. Which one?
CAP COM
Okay. Stand by one.
SC
Is it the one Jack wrote them all
in? The big long feed out? He also wrote something in
the G&N book.
CAP COM It's in the big, long one he wrote out
at about EI minus 230. EMS entry check.
SC
Okay. He's coming back down with it.
CAP COM
Meanwhile, Fred, I've got 2 for you
on the LM prep checklist.
SC
Okay. Jack's here now. I'll hand
it down.
SC
Okay. Houston. Aquarius.
CAP COM
Hello, Aquarius. I've got a couple
of changes for you on your CSM checklist.
SC
Okay. Stand by one. Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, Jack. The timeline between
EI minus 230 and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really
going to have to hussle and we've decided to delete the
EMS entry check at minus 230. That will give you a little
more time in there. What we've decided to do with it is
wait until after EI minus 1, just before you initialize the
EMS. If you have time, and only if you have time, do the
EMS entry check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into
EMS and initialization. Understand.
SC
Okay. You're going to delete between
2 hours and 30 minutes and 2:15 there and you're going to
add it, if there is time, only if there is time, at EI
minus 1 hour where the EMS initialization occurs.
CAP COM That's right. You got it correctly.
Okay, Jack. One other item. Just before EI minus 2 hours
and 15 minutes, we need (garbled) VERB 74 enter. Over.

Okay. Stand by one, would you?
Okay. Right before 2 hours and 15 minutes, I assume that's

before (garbled) give their P27 update,
I do a VERB 74. Right?
CAP COM
That's affirmative, Jack.
CAPCOM
How much sleep did you get, Jack?
SC
Oh, I guess stand by. I guess
maybe 2 or 3 hours. It was awful cold and it wasn't very
good sleep.
CAP COM
Roger. You plan to try to get any
more?
SC
What GET do you have?
CAP COM
We got 132:37.
S C
Well, if I get everything done, I'll
try, but I'll tell you, it's almost impossible to sleep.
All of us have that same problem. It's just too cold to
sleep.
CAP COM Roger. The way we're looking at it, looks
like you ought to have a couple of free hours here before
you have to really get with it.
SC
We'll take it easy, but I - you know,
we'll try to sleep, but it's just awful cold.
CAP COM Present data indicates that your
entry angles minus 6.03 degrees. You DELTA V at the mid-
course is going to 2.8 feet a second.
SC
Okay. Copy.
SC
Jack, this is Jim. I understand this
is going to be an RCS burn.
CAP COM That's affirmative, Jim. It's going
to be an RCS burn.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM And we need the suit circuit relief
valve back to AUTO. Correction back to CLOSE.
SC
Hey, Jack, that didn't work. And
one thing, comparing Jim's checklist with my own, I find
one difference there at EI minus 2:30. His checklist has
me changing a - opening a EPS sensor signal circuit breaker
right prior to turning off LM power. Is I'd like to find
out which checklist is correct.
CAP COM Hey, Jack, the LM checklist is just
for information to Jim. It's just to tell him that you're
changing back to command module power. Your checklist is
correct.
SC
Okay. And when do you figure that
you'll be sending up the pads that you have?
CAP COM Aquarius, all of your pad will be
coming up in about 3 and a half hours, at EI minus 6:30.
And one thing we want to remind you of when you remove power
from the command module LM umbilical is to be sure that
you open the LM power main B circuit breakers both of them
before you start throwing the switches and circuit breaker
in the LM. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedures

--- PAGE 840 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-16-70 CST 2:00A GET 132:30:00 586/3
CAPCOM in that order. Over.
SC
Okay. That's the way we planned on
it. We'll let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us when
we're go from there. What page is those changes on?
CAPCOM Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you
is at the end of power removal from the command module LM
umbilical. And just for your information, after you go
through that entire procedure and about the time you're ready
to transfer to the command module, at that time, power will
be removed from the umbilical and it's okay to disconnect
it. That is, after you've thrown the switches in the LM.
Is that clear?
SC
Roger. That's where I've got a
remark here to check with you to see if it's all right to
proceed.
CAPCOM Roger. And that would be just after
panel 16, you open the ascent ECA control breakers.
SC
What's that number at that?
SC
The confusing thing is, Jack,
where they told me to ait from this then go before proceeding
was that bat 2 low volts off reset then on.
CAP COM Okay. That's still affirmative.
We'll give you a go after waiting 5 seconds and then down
from there just a few steps, after you have opened the
ascent ECA control breakers on panel 16, at that point,
the umbilical is not powered and it's okay to disconnect
them should you care to do SO.
SC
Okay. After the last step, then,
I'm free to disconnect.
CAPCOM Right. And one other change we
have is the shortly after that, where we're configuring
for jettison, we have closed both the forward dump valve
and the overhead dump valve. And we don't want to get in
a locked up position like that, so one way to get around it
is to - after we close the forward dump valve, turn the
descent oxygen valve off. Over.
SC
Okay. After the forward dump valve
add a sub in that says the descent off the valve off.
CAP COM Okay, Fred. That concludes the
DELTA's. And perhaps, you heard that our GAMMA's are still
minus 6.03 and our DELTA V will be at 2.8 foot per second.
RCS burn.

Roger.

CAP COM Fred-0, We've got one more change we'd
like to give you to clarify a question that Jack asked
earlier. At EI minus 230 -
SC
Okay, hold on a minute, Jack. I meant
to call Jack back down. I'm not familiar with the previous
discussion.
CAP COM Negative. This is on your checklist.
SC
Okay. Go ahead.
CAP COM At EI minus 230, during power removal
from the umbilical, first thing we do is 2 steps with the
CSM. We open the main B - - the LM powered main B powered circuit
breakers and then there's a third step which says, circuit
breaker EPS sensor signal Main B open. Just delete that
step. Over.
SC
Okay. Delete the third step.
CAP COM
And Aquarius, for your information, as far
as our water supply is concerned including our plans for power up,
we have an additional 18 hours of water remaining from this
point.
SC
Okay. 18 hours of water remaining from
this point, Jack.
SC
Hello, Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Hello, Aquarius. Go ahead.
SC
Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want
to make sure that you'll fill in any of the changes to the
checklist that come up, and make sure that they're absolutely
essential. When we don't have procedures, we can only do
it one time, and we can't make changes at the last minute. We'd
like to do the best that's conceivably possible, but unless the
changes are really essential, don't bother sending them up.
CAP COM Roger. We won't. The Chairman of the
CPCB is still active, and one thing that we're trying to do
is to save you all the time we can between EI minus 230 and
1 hour.
SC
That's affirm. That's a real important
time.
CAP COM For your information, Jim. I don't
know whether you heard that originally, but time for 2 1/2 to
1 has been run about 3 times, and it's pretty tight, so we've
tried to weed out what we could which isn't much, but I think
the other message you might impress on Jack when you get
around to winding that platform don't try to get it
down too neat. It doesn't have to be all that good. Just
do a nice quick and dirty one and that's going to be good
enough anyway.
SC
I concur. I think for reentry,
we don't have to have a real accurate platform, but I haven't
told Jack that.

CAP COM Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and
things are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of other
things to think about. One specifically. I know that none
of you are sleeping worth a damn, because it's SO cold, and
you might want to dig out the medical kit there around 135

That's right. As a matter of fact, doing
this alinement on the Earth will kind of be like making a

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 133 hours 11 min-
utes. At 132 hours 28 minutes CAP COM Jack Lousma put in a
call to the crew. Fred Haise responded and we had him turn
on the power amplifier which addition to greatly improving
the quality of voice communications we get, also gives us
ranging data which the Flight Dynamics Officer's using for
making final computations of the midcourse correction to be
performed in about 4 and a half hours. Jack Swigert reported
that he received - gotten about 2 to 3 hours sleep which he
said was not very good sleep due to the cold in the command
module. Swigert said it is almost impossible to sleep because
of the cold and Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew
Operations, and who has been at the CAPCOM console a good
part of the evening and into this morning, came on the circuit
and advised Jim Lovell to consider taking Dexedrine tablets
for each of the crewmen. This is a stimulant contained in
the medical kit. Lovell said that they had considered that
and would think about it. At the present time Apollo 13 is
60 249 nautical miles from the Earth. The spacecraft velocity
is up to 7900 feet per second and we're some 9 hours 27 min-
utes until reentry. We'll continue to stand by for any
further communications with the crew. We don't have any plan
to pass up to them in the next few minutes or SO. One of
the things under discussion, however, at the present time in
Mission Control are procedures which might possibly be used
to increase the temperature in the Lunar Module and the LM
environmental and electrical systems engineer's looking into
the power status right now. As far as consumables are con-
cerned, with the possibility in mind that perhaps bringing
some additional equipment on line in the LM to bring the
temperature up there.

We're presently showing the cabin temperature
in the lunar module at about 54 degrees, and although we do
not have a measurement on the command module we presume that
it is lower than that, and we'll continue to keep you advised
on the status of the discussion going on at present in Mission
Control on the advisability of powering up the LM more fully
to bring up the temperature.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM
Okay skipper, we figured out a way for
you to keep warm. We decided to start powering you up now, and
what we want you to do is stick your entry LM prep check list
and start at the top where it says Bat 5 normal feed on and
then jump over as it says to your 30 minute activation, and
do all of the 30 minute activation up to but not including the
burn. Uou copy?
SC
Okay, if I understand you correctly
then that gives me leeway to maneuver when we get up to
activation complete and we can be in position for the burn
but we will not burn. We don't have a pad anyway.
CAP COM That's affirm Jim. You could maneuver
to burn attitude or you could maneuver to an attitude which
should put the sun in the windows to warm the place up.
SC
Sounds good and you're sure we have
plenty of electrical power to do this.
CAP COM That's affirmative. We've got plenty
of power to do it. I can get you a number though.
CAP COM Jim, you've got about 100 percent margins
on everything from here on in.
SC
That sounds encouraging.
CAP COM
Rog. That's in the LM. We're not talking
about the CSM right now.
SC
I understand.

Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go ahead, Aquarius.
SC
Okay, question, this short turn-on step
3 on page 24 has us only turning on the oxygen system AB 2
clocks and the breakers are still out on panel 11. Do you want
those in too or are we just going to use 1 set of heaters.
CAP COM
Stand by.
CAPCOM Aquarius, Houston, go as the checklist
recommends for now, when you get into the circuit breaker
panel configuration you're going to get the number 1 set of
heaters on anyway.

CAP COM Aquarius, Houston. One other way to
warm things up in a hurry in there is when you get your ac on
to turn on the window heaters.
SC
Okay. I guess the only question I have is
what the (Garbled) will do to it - it looks like almost a frost
on it now. As I said Jack, I'd like to let it maybe warm up
just a little bit more before hitting it with the heatload.
CAP COM
Not a bad idea.
SC
And as you can see Houston, turn on we
got our old friend down link 2 pass.
CAP COM Roger. We've seen it Fred. Aquarius,
Houston. It looks like you're proceeding toward the gimbal lock
there. We'd like you to check that please.
SC
Roger. There's not much we can do about
it. We can't use the boosters, Houston.
CAP COM Okay, forget it now, we'll get it later.
SC
And Houston, Aquarius, I got the next thing for
the PNG for the course align 000 but I guess we ought to hold up
now until we get the up time on the RCS thrusters.
CAP COM Roger. We're looking at them. We'll give
you the go on them. Okay, Aquarius, your quads are 120 to 133
now, so you're cleared for thrusters.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM
Rog. Did you get my go for RCS?
SC
That's affirm. (Garbled) all we're doing
now Jack is letting the spacecraft drift in its mode to pick
up the earth again.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
I don't want to just go flying throughout the sky
and get high rates because I don't have any od the down rates
(garbled) on until the earth comes back up again, and once I get
the earth in sight, we have strain on down rates no (Garbled)

This is Apollo Control at 133 hour, 55 minutes.
Jim Lovell has stabilized the spacecraft at this point using
the LM reaction control system thrusters. We're showing a
power level on the lunar module right now ranging between
45 and 50 amps. The power up procedure followed by the crew
will have another effect in addition to warming up the LM,
and that is they're beginning a portion of the preentry checklist
that had been scheduled for 6 hours prior to entry interface,
and that was begun at about 9 hours. So, they '11 be getting
a bit of a leg up on that portion of the time line. At the
present time Apollo 13 is -
SC
Jack I guess we haven't changed our

This is Apollo Control at 134 hours 42 minutes.
The crew began powering up the Lunar Module at about 133 hours
29 minutes. A little over an hour ago, we've since seen the
currents in the Lunar Module come up from about 10 to 12 amps
to their present level of about 40 amps. These currents
actually went to a high of about 70 amps befoe stablizing out
at the lower level as the heaters came on line and brought the
equipment up to a proper temperature and then dropped off
line. The crew reported it is getting somewhat warmer within
the Lunar Module at this time. The accounted temperature
reading that we have on the ground is based on the temperature

of the glycol and water boiler, which is re-
lated to the amount of heat being transferred into the water
boiler, and is about the best indication we have of cabin
temperature. And that shows that the cabin temperature now
has come up from about 54 degrees to about 56 degrees. This
temperature, however, does show some lag and we would expect
the cabin temperature has come up propably a bit more than
is indicated by the temperature we're showing on the ground.
SC
Got some plan in vectors for us, Jack?
CAP COM
Okay, Fredo. With the Sun I've got 246, for
the Moon I've got 250.

PAO
This is Apollo Control at 134 hours
56 minutes. In Mission Control at this time, we're in the
process of handing over shifts. Flight Director, Gene Kranz
is taking over from Flight Director, Milton Windler. We
will not have a change of shift briefing. The Flight Director
plans to remain in the Control Center through splashdown,
and we therefore, as I said, will not have a change of shift
briefing - news briefing for this shift. In summarizing,
briefly the events during the past 8 hours, from about
127 hours until about 130 hours, we passed up the Command
Module and Lunar Module preentry checklists to the crew.
Following this, the crew was advised to attempt to get some
rest. Fred Haise remained on watch, but we limited the
number of calls to the spacecraft to allow Fred also to get
some rest, and about 128 hours 17 minutes, Jim Lovell and
Jack Swigert indicated that they were going to begin a rest
period. Fred Haise began a rest period at about 129 hours
39 minutes. At 132 hours 28 minutes, we put in the first call to
the crew after Haise began his rest period. All three crewmen
responded shortly thereafter, and Jack Swigert reported that
they had gotten about 2 or 3 hours of sleep. They said that
it was not very good sleep, that it had been quite cold, and
almost impossible to sleep. Deke Slayton, Director of Flight
Crew Operations who has been in the Control Center during
the night and early morning advised Lovell at that point to
consider taking dexedrine tablet. This is a stimulate carried
in the medical kit. Lovell said he would consider it. We've
heard no report from the crew at this time as to whether they
have or not taken any medication. In response to the crew
comments on the cold, we began looking at some methods of
bringing the LM temperatures up. It was decided that we
had adequate power margins in the LM batteries and also
adequate water margins to power up the LM early, and this
had been planned to occur at 6 hours prior to reentry, and
we began the procedure about 3 hours earlier than that. Begin-
ning to power up at about 9 hours prior to entry interface. At
133 hours 29 minutes, the crew began the checklist procedures
to power up the LM and the current levels in the LM came up
from about 10 to 12 amps, which is the normal power down,
current level to about 70 amps, and then as heaters brought
equipment up to temperature, and the heaters began to drop
off line, the temperature stabilized out at about 40 amps,
and the crew reported the temperature is coming up within the
LM and we've seen a corresponding rise in temperature on our
displays here. The temperature we were reading in the cabin
prior to the power up was about 54 degrees since the equipment

- has been turned on, we've seen the
temperature come up about 2 to 3 degrees. At the present time,
we're 7 hours 40 minutes 54 seconds from entry interface, and
2 hours 40 minutes 51 seconds from the mid-course correction.
Correction number 7, which is planned to occur 5 hours prior
to reentry. The Flight Dynamics Officer is computing final
maneuver PAD for this mid-course correction. The preliminary
information on it was that it would be about 2.8 feet per
second using the LM ascent stage actually the LM reaction
control system thrusters, and burning them for about 21 seconds
duration. We expect that we will get an update to this when
the FLight Dynamics Officer completes the final computations
for the maneuver. We will also have some preliminary numbers
for the entry. We suspect that these will change once the
mid-course correction is completed. These are the same numbers
which were passed out at the previous change of shift briefing.
They are as follows: We are predicting entry interface at a
point in which the spacecraft reaches the 400 000 foot level
to occur at 142 hours 40 minutes 40 seconds. The drogue
chutes would deploy at 142 hours 48 minutes 53 seconds, and
the main chutes, the main parachutes would come out at 142
hours 49 minutes 43 seconds with splashdown at 142 hours
54 minutes 40 seconds. As I said, we expect these times will
shift somewhat when the mid-course correction has been completed.
We also have the times for the beginning of blackout and the
end of blackout.
CAP COM
Yes. It was good training.
PAO
The time we show for the beginning of
blackout is 142 hours 40 minutes 58 seconds, and time for
ending of blackout is 142 hours 44 minutes 3 seconds.
SC
Jack, that's what it says the torquing
angles are.
CAP COM We haven't got them yet. Aquarius,
hold on the torquing angles, please.
SC
We're doing that.
CAP COM Jim, the reason for the delay is that
we're not seeing the data yet. We're having to check a point
here, and as soon as they come up, we'll let you know what
to do with them.
SC
Okay. We had a large (garbled). 112

CAP COM Okay Jim, we're looking at doing this in
the service module Sep attitude and the optics will be pointed
away from the sun, so, it should be a good attitude for a
P52.
SC
Okay. So, we'll be going to the service
module Sep attitude and which time we'll do a Dock course align,
and then you want, you want Jack then to do a P52?
CAPCOM The way we'll do that in our time line
Jim, is to go ahead and do the service module jet and then
we'll just stay in that attitude and when it comes time in
our time line as we've outlined bring the platform up, we'll
proceed with the P52, course align, and then the P52.
SC
Okay. Are we going to use the same
techniques that we normally do for LM activation, in other
words, I try to maintain an attitude and give him some angles
and then are you going to give him the angles, then he does
the 52.
CAPCOM
Basically it's the same procedure just
reversed Jim.

Okay.
CAP COM
The other nice thing about this, it's
one we've done before.

we do not plan to do it to proceed with the command module
power up prematurely.

Okay, I just wanted to talk over with
you, it looks like we've had some changes in the flight plan
here, due to Jim's P52. Do you have can you talk over with
me what your plans are?
CAP COM Roger Jack. Since we've got the PNGs
up we plan to use that information to give the CMC a docked
course align and then we're in the service module jettison
attitude we'll wait until it comes time to power up the CMC
and we'll get a CMC a docked course align, and we'll pick some
good stars to give you a fine align with, and it looks like
we can pick some stars that are looking away from the sun
in which you can find in that service module jettison attitude,
so, we'll save you quite a bit of gas and save you some time
in a very busy time.

You're going the wrong way son.
PAO
That was Donald K. Slayton who came on the
Capcom line to point out to Jim Lovell that they're headed
the wrong way for Fra Mauro and Cone Crater. Our displays
now show Apollo 13 at 47 858 nautical miles out from earth.
Velocity reading 8956 feet per second. We're at 135 hours,
48 minutes, now into the flight of Apollo 13. This is Apollo
Control Houston.
SC
Okay Jack, it looks, just looking over
what I may expect here, it looks like I'm just going to get
3 angles to do a verb 41 noun 20 right?
CAP COM That's what it looks like from here Jack.
It's pretty much the opposite of the LM activation procedure
where we do the docked course align.
SC
Yes, except in a way we did a lot of
verb 06 noun 20 enters simultaneously and then you all ship him
up post torque values. You're not going to do anything like
that are you?
CAPCOM
Say again please Jack.
SC
Okay. During the activation parts we
do a lot of verb 06 noun 20 enters simultaneously reading
you out the difference in the angles and then this then inverted
to say post torquing angles, in order to get the platform
fine aligned. Do you plan something like that or just 3 course
align angles.
CAP COM
Jack, we're going to give you 3 course
align angles and then you can go right to your checklist as
we're giving it and start in with the verb 40 noun 20.
SC
Okay, real fine.

We brought the lunar module power up
about 3 hours early this morning, because Apollo 13 now has
the luxury of margins in both power and water. This does give
an added bonus. It puts the 13 crew a step ahead in what
could be considered a very busy time line. We're now at

Okay. I just can't write - I just
can't read my writing. Essential instrumentation power
main B closed.
CAPCOM
That's affirmative.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.

Go ahead, Joe.
CAP COM
Roger. The word we have is that
you can't make a VERB 49 maneuver to the LM jettison atti-
tude because those are FDAI angles we gave you. They don't
correspond to the gimbal angles for the load. It'll have
to be a manual maneuver. Over.

Apollo Control, Houston at 136 hours
26 minutes now into the flight. Our clock in Mission
Control shows the time of ignition for the midcourse burn
at 1 hour 14 minutes from this time. 30 minutes after the
midcourse, or 4-1/2 hours prior to entry interface, the
service module is scheduled to be jettisoned. At that
time Jack Swigert will be in the command module. Jim Lovell
and Fred Haise in the lunar module. Lovell will fire the
lunar module thrust to push the service module about 1/2
foot per second. Swigert, then, activates the pyros with
a switch in the command module. After separation, Apollo 13
will back off with the lunar module reaction control system
at 1/2 foot per second providing a separation DELTA velocity
of 1 foot per second. All three crewmen will be trying to
take pictures of the service module at that time. Swigert
out of window number 5 in the command module. Lovell and
Haise out of the lunar module. Upon separation, Apollo 13
will pitch about 90 degrees along the radial axis. That
would be 90 degrees off the flight path angle. And at

Okay. Now (garbled) with the PNGS
that you gave us for a PNGS attitude. Is this the wrong
one? Do you want me to just aline up the earth as I did
before in the last midcourse?

Read me your FDAI angles and let's compare them with what
we have down here.

Okay. You're looking at them in the
DSKY I've got roll of 847, pitch of about 051 and yaw
looking at about 3.750.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. Those are very close -
I guess all you need to do is trim them up a bit.
SC
I plan to do a final trim - auto trim.
And then a 4 jet translation.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. For fuel conservation,
we'd prefer you to trim it up min impulse and there's really
very little trim required. And then go ahead and do it AGS.
We're on the expected fuel usage, but we're just being old
ladies about it.
SC
Okay. Understand. My only question
Joe, is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles D&D

not go to null when I did an auto
maneuver. I tried to go manaully to the attitude and then
went to auto but the roll and the yaw do not coming at all.
CAP COM Roger. I haven't got an answer on
that yet, but your attitude looks very close.
SC
Okay. I can (garbled). And Houston,
Aquarius. I'm not sure that if I follow and null the needles
that will be the proper attitude.
CAP COM Okay. Stand by one, Jim. We're talk-
ing about it. It's going to be very close in any event close
enough.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM And, Jim, just for your information,
I have the entry pad. I have the landing area weather summary

will be done retrograde. It's a relatively long duration
on the burn.
SC
Houston, do you want me to null
the PNGS needles manually?
CAP COM Okay. Stand by one more minute, Jim.
PAO
- - relatively long duration on the
burn because of the large spacecraft weight at this time.
We show the spacecraft weight at 87 649 pounds at the present.
Again the midcourse burn will be done retrograde. We're
at 137 hours 16 minutes linto the flight. We show Apollo 13

comparing the balls here and out
the window it doesn't look too unreasonable, and if Jim
says the COAS is yawed and roll slightly off from what he
might eyeball, but yet, the FDAI air needles for PNGS are
showing a full scale left in roll and full scale left in
yaw. (garbled)

not 21 seconds. We're at 137 hours 35 minutes into the
Flight. We show Apollo 13 at 38 303 nautical miles away from
Earth, and with a velocity of 10 045 feet per second. Less

38 303 nautical miles away from earth, and with a velocity
of 10 045 feet per second. Less than 5 minutes now away
from scheduled time of ignition.
SC
Okay Houston, about 3 minutes to go
and we're all squared away.
CAP COM And Aquarius, Houston roger that and
we're standing by for your body axis align and your zeroing
404 405, 406 going to 470.
SC
Okay. You'd asked me before Joe to go up
400 plus 3 which I did. I assume you've changed the script
again.
PAO
Less than 2 minutes away now from scheduled
time of ignition. We're at 137 hours, 38 minutes in the flight.
CAP COM Okay Fred, we did tell you to do that
a while ago and it doesn't matter, you're looking good.
SC
Okay.
PAO
One minute away now.
PAO
Ten seconds away now.
SC
Yes, it looks like we had a minus point 2
bias at 470, we're burning.
CAP COM
Copy that Fred.
PAO
Fred Haise reporting that the burn is
underway. We're at 137 hours, 40 minutes into the flight.
PAO
We've shut down.
CAP COM
Roger. (Garbled)
SC
Okay up here.
SC
Okay if you're happy can we maneuver to
service module Sep attitude now?
CAP COM
That's affirmative Aquarius.
PAO
That was Fred Haise requesting that 13
maneuver to service module separation attitude following this
this burn which went right on the money. We're at 137 hours,
41 minutes.
SC
- to the proper attitude.
CAP COM
Okay, we're looking at it.
SC
And again it's necessary to use the GTZA
to pitch.
CAP COM
Okay. Affirmative

PAO
For the Service module separation, Apollo 13
will pitch about 90 degrees along the radial axis. That's 90
degrees off the flight path angle. We show 13 at the present
time at a distance of 37 581 nautical miles away with a velocity
of 10 138 feet per second. We're now at 137 hours, 42 minutes
into the mission. This is Apollo Control Houston.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead, Houston.
CAP COM
Okay, recommend you terminate P41.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM
Hey, Jim, have you broken into the medical
kit per our recommendation a few hours ago?
SC
Yeah, everything is taken care of Deke.
CAP COM
Okay, fine. You might hit it again in
about 2 hours.
SC
Okay.
PAO
Apollo Control Houston, 137 hours, 48 min-
utes. That was Donald K. Slayton on the line talking to Jim
Lovell; the recommendation he referred to was the recommendation
he made earlier in the morning that the Apollo 13 crew take
Dexedrine tablets. We now show Apollo 13 in an altitude of
36 969 nautical miles. Apollo Control, Houston. The guidance
and control officer for the lunar module here in mission control
confirms they are moving in an attitude now for separation.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston, aft omni.
SC
I beat you to it Houston.
CAP COM
Yeah, I thought you did, but I thought I'd
say it anyway.
PAO
Our count down clock shows that we are
19 minutes away now from time of separation; service module
jettison; for this Jack Swigert is in the command module; Jim
Lovell and Fred Haise in the lunar module; Commander Lovell will
fire the thruster, or fire the thrust, LM thrust to push the service
module at one half foot per second; Swigert activates the
PYROS with a switch in the command module. After separation,
13 will back off with the lunar module RCS at one half foot
per second, providing the separation delta velocity of one
foot per second. We are 137 hours, 52 minutes into the flight
and Apollo 13 now 36 616 nautical miles away; this is Apollo
Control Houston.
CAP COM Okay, Aquarius, Houston. That attitude
looks pretty good; how's Jack getting along?
SC
He's getting along; all but the PNGS ATT hold.
CAPCOM
Roger.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
AQUARIUS Go ahead.
CAP COM
Roger, again for fuel consumption reasons,
we would like you to go back to the AGS Mode that you were in,
rather than PGNS, ATT hold.

--- PAGE 872 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY, 4/17/70 CST 6:55A GET 137:42:00 600/2
SC
Okay, I'm in PGNS minimum impulse right
now while we are firing.
AQUARIUS And I'll go back to the AGS mode.
CAP COM
Okay, Jim, PGNS minimum impulse is okay;
ags is okay too, its your choice.
SC
Soon as we get rid of the service module,
Joe, I think I'll be able to maneuver a lot better.
CAP COM
Sure thing.
SC
Okay, Jack, this is the point where all
thrusters fire up both rings.
CAPCOM Real fine. Real fine.
CAPCOM That was the test of the thrusters on
the command module, and as you heard, they all fired - we
are at 137 hours, 58 minutes into the flight, and this is
Apollo Control Houston.
SC
And SM jett at 138:12.
CAP COM
Roger - understand. SM jet 138:12.
Its not that time critical Jim.
SC
Can we do it at any time, Joe?
CAP COM
I think so, but let me check.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston, that is affirmative;
you can jettison the service module when you are ready, no
big rush, but any time.
SC
Okay; sounds good.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM
Roger. We recommend that you use the
AGS for the separation maneuver, because we would like to get
the proper weight in, for the DAP, before we use the PGNS.
SC
Roger - we will.
SC
Stand by.
PAO
Apollo Control Houston, 138 hours, 1
minutes into the flight; as you heard earlier, Joe Kerwin
told Apollo 13 that they could separate at their convenience,
that followed a time identified by Jim Lovell, which would
be some 2 minutes after what we had earlier carried on the
ground, we now show Apollo 13 at a distance of 35,729 nautical
miles away from Earth, traveling at a speed of 10,400 feet
per second. At 138 hours, 2 minutes, into the flight, this
is Apollo Control Houston.
SC
And that's
SEP.
CAP COM
Copy that.
PAO
We copied that report from Jim Lovell,
that service module separation at 138 hours, 2 minutes, 8
seconds. And as you heard, that was ahead of schedule.
We presently show Apollo 13 at 35, 611 nautical miles away
from Earth.

Beautiful, beautiful. And for your information,
Jim, you'll be coming up on an RCS caution light, prettily and
no sweat. Over.

And there's one whole side of that spacecraft
missing.
CAP COM
Is that right?
SC
Right by the, look out there, wait a minute.
Right by the high gain antenna, the whole panel is blown out,
almost from the base to the engine.
CAPCOM
Copy that.
SC
It looks like it got to the SPS valve too, Houston.
CAP COM
You could see the SPS engine go, huh?
SC
The way it looked. Just a dark brown streak.
It's really a mess.
PAO
You heard that report from Jim Lovell, as Aquarius
is moving away from the service module at the present time.
CAP COM Take pictures, but we want you to conserve RCS.
Don't make unnecessary manuevers. And Jim, Houston, in particular,
of course, we don't want any translation manuevers.
SC
Right on that. Joe you realize that when I went
up to the SM SEP attitude I had to use GP CA to do it.
CAP COM That's affirm. We know that. That's okay.
PAO
Fred Haise followed Jim's remark with the comment
that it got through the service propulsion system bell 2. That
it was really a mess. We're at 138 hours 7 minutes into the flight.
Apollo 13 now 35 200 nautical miles -

Looking out the windows now, Houston.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay Joe, I'm looking down the SPS bell, and it looks
okay on the inside, maybe it was just a -
CAP COM Okay, copy that Fred. Was the bell deformed on
the outside or just nicked or what?
SC
I think the explosion, from what I could see
Joe had stages, I don't know whether it did any actual deformation
or not.
CAP COM
Okay.

And Joe, looks like a lot of debris is just hanging
out the side near the S-band antenna.

cleaned up, we've got the entry pad and the landing area
summary for you.
PAO
Needless to say, all of these gentlemen
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM
Go ahead.

Okay, copy that, Jack. Stand by one.
PAO
Needless to say, all of the distinguished
visitors in the Control Center were most interested in the re-
port from Apollo 13 of the service module condition, as the
13 crew moved away following the jettison.
CAP COM Jack, Houston. How long did you hold
PROCEED before you quit on it?
SC
Well it was varying length. Is it
supposed to be a long-time PROCEED?
CAP COM We think it may be, Jack. We think it
may be 15 to 20 seconds, and our recommendation is that you
throw and hold it down for a good period of time, probably
half a minute or more and see if the (garble)
SC
Okay. Alright, I didn't hold it in
that long. Maybe 2 or 3 seconds is as long as I held it. Okay
and we're - -
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Okay, Jack just came down to the tunnel
again and said the computer is okay.
CAP COM Okay. Good to hear it. And did you
ever get that batt C main A reading for us?
SC
I did the reading of the batt alright,
but forgot to give it to you, I guess. Stand by.
CAP COM
Okay.
SC
Batt C current was 2 amps and batt A
voltage 30.2.
CAP COM Copy. 2 amps, 30.2. And that sounds
good to us, Jim.
CAP COM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, we'd to have Jack verify that the
pyros in logic are safe, and we'd like to remind him to do no
further power up of the CSM until EI minus 2 plus 30.
SC
Roger. He reports that the pyros are
safe and we're standing by for 2:30.

been filled with excitement.
CAP COM
Well, James, if you can't take any
better care of the spacecraft than that, we might not give
you another one.
CAPCOM Hey, Jim, Houston. You might ask Jack
while he's down there to take a peek through the telescope
and tell us whether he can see any stars. Over.
SC
Okay.
PAO
That time earlier identified at 2 hours
and 30 minutes is the time in the flight plan that the command
module batteries will be brought on the line. In a normal
mission, the batteries would not be brought up until some
30 minutes prior to entry into the earth's atmosphere. We
show Apollo 13 presently 33 369 nautical miles away, velocity
now reading 10 757 feet per second. This is Apollo Control
Houston.

Joe, Jack tells me that there's still
a lot of particles floating around and he can't pick out
any constellation that he recognizes so far. But it might
clear here in a little while.

Okay. E COMM is looking at that battery
amperage that you gave us a while ago. He'd like to see it
about a half an amp to an amp lower. We'd like you to ask
Jack to just check the circuit breaker switches that he's
pulled in so far and make sure he doesn't have any extra loads
on main A, specifically the flood light configuration and his
caution and warning circuit breakers and his essential instru-
mentation power circuit breakers. Over.

Okay, will do.
SC
Okay, Joe, this is Jack.
CAPCOM
Go ahead.
SC
Okay. I've been not reading any voltage
at all on bat B, and the amperage looks like about 2 amps, but
that could be kind of noise level stuff. I've got all the flood
lights off and I - can you think of anything - I'd like to
power down the lower main A.
CAPCOM
Okay, how about reading the voltage off
of main A.
SC
Okay, oh, this is Ken. Okay. Ken, it
was 30.2.
CAP COM
Okay. We're checking out the flood lights
we need. Actually, Jack, you ought to be able to go ahead and
use the lights we gave you. There's no reason to sit in the
dark. They're supposed to be coming off of main B and we're
checking that now.
SC
Okay, it's not bad down there. We're in
plenty of light, but should I be reading the voltage on bat C?
CAPCOM Jack, you should be reading bat C voltage.
That circiut breaker should be open.
SC
Okay. Okay, can you think of anything else
you want to get turned off to lighten load on main A?
CAP COM Okay, we're (garbled) that subject right
now, Jack. It's really not that big a thing, just something
we wanted to dress up.

Did you read that off?
SC
I did and he said it's down in the mud,
it's less than 2 amps.

when we get to that point, we have some stars with corresponding
shaft and trunnion angles to pass to him as backups in case
the computer doesn't happen to point him straight at one.

real good.
SC
Okay.
CAP COM And I've got two things we'd like Jack
to do in the command module to ease the load on main A, one
of them is to verify or turn the CM RCS heater switch to OFF,
we are done with that, and even though the circuit breakers
are pulled, the switches might be drawing a little current.
And the second one is we would like him to turn SCS logic
power 2/3 to OFF; we don't need it now; its called up in the
checklist at the appropriate time, and we'd like him to turn
that off. Over.
SC
Okay, I'll tell Jack to check to see if
the CM RCS heaters switch is OFF, and if not turn it off, and also
turn off the SDS logic power 2/3 switch off, when comes up
later in the checklist.

Houston, Aquarius.
CAP COM
Go Aquarius.
SC
Okay how about my pitch attitude of
about 115 instead of about 91. I think Jack can use the
optics a little bit better at that angle.
CAPCOM Jim - that's perfectly okay with us;
if it looks good for stars.
SC
He just looked at them briefly, I'll go
down and let him look a little bit better here.
CAP COM Okay, with the new attitude of shaft
and trunnion angles we were going to pass him don't mean
anything, but its more important to have a good star field.

CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Okay, Jim. We've been talking about
your going to a different attitude than the pad attitude for
better star field vision on the command module and what we'd
like to have you do is this: If you can predict now or some-
time soon what attitude it is that you would like to hold
at that time and go to that attitude now, we'd like to be able
to compute the course aline gimbal angles for the CSM and we
can do that if you go to the selected attitude, hold it, call
up a VERB 06 NOUN 20 and read us your LM gimbal angles, we
can take those and compute CSM course aline gimbal angles on
the assumtion that when we get back into the CSM course aline
you will return to that selected attitude. Does that sound
okay? Over.
SC
Yes, I'll try to hold the attitude we
select directly while you're giving me the course aline
attitude. We're not too sure what's the best attitude. I'm
going to ask Jack again if 115 is sufficient for him.
CAPCOM Okay, you can take some time figuring
out the best attitude and then you won't have to hold it all
the way from now until then if you just get back to it.
SC
Houston, Jack would like to know what
constellations are in his (garbled) field of view at an
attitude of about 105 pitch, 0 roll, 0 yaw. Can you give that
to us?
CAP COM Okay, we'll sure give it a go. As I
said we have some stars. They're not centered with the shaft
and trunnion zero. Let us take a quick look at 105 pitch
shaft and trunnion zero and see if we can get you an answer.
CAP COM Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM Roger. None of these stars will be
exactly centered, but at a pitch attitude of 115 we had
computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague, and Deneb would all be
in the telescope field of view and the first 3 were also in
view at 91 degree pitch, SO he should be able to see one or
more of those 4 stars. Over.
SC
Okay, thank you very much.
CAP COM
Okay, and Jim, I can give shaft and
trunnions if he's interested.
SC
Okay, why don't you give us the shaft
and trunnion for, say Altair at 115 and I'll go up there and
I'll see if he can pick it up.
CAP COM Okay, real fine. At 115 degrees of
pitch, Altair, shaft 274, trunnion 22.2. Over.
SC
Roger, shaft is 274, trunnion 22.2.
CAP COM
That's affirm.

CAP COM
Okay, Aquarius, Houston. With the present
amount of power you've got in the LM, which is over 500 amp
hours and the rate you're using them we figure you've got
almost 12 hours of power left.

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-17-70 CST 8:31A GET 139:18:20 607/1
PAO
This is Apollo Control Houston. We're now
at 139 hours 19 minutes into the flight. Our digital displays
show the Apollo 13 spacecraft at a distance of 27 698 nautical
miles away from earth. Velocity increasing, now reading
11 779 feet per second. As you heard the discussion earlier
about LM descent battery number 3 has been taken off the line.
Five batteries, including 2 in the ascent stage are now on
the line. This gives almost 12 hours of light time remaining.
To quickly recap what has transpired earlier, the midcourse
burn number 7 was performed as scheduled at 137 hours 39 minutes
48 seconds into the flight. This was a burn of 23 seconds in
duration with a DELTA-V of 3 feet per second. Our flight
dynamics tracking confirms that the burn was performed pre-
cisely as planned. Command Module Pilot, Jack Swigert is
now in the command module. Earlier he powered up the main
B US B, and powered up some of the equipment in his checkout
process. The command module computer was verified as looking
good. Service Module separation occurred a little earlier
then planned. Of course, this is not a time critical event.
Jim Lovell decided to separate from the service module some
8 minutes in advance of that time previously considered. We
copied a separation time -
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
SC
I ran back there to take a look to see what I
could see of this in the (garble). It looks pretty grim back
there right now. It might be that we have to go across the line
and maybe copy the fine line docking angles if we have time.
CAP COM Okay. We'd like to do that to. Wait a
minute. Stand by Jim.
PAO
We copied service module separation 138 hours
2 minutes 8 seconds ground elapsed time. Jim Lovell vividly
described the condition of the service module as Apollo 13
moved away from it as having 1 whole side missing. Fred Haise
then reported that the service propulsion system engine bell
appeared damaged. Looking ahead, we plan to bring up the
command module batteries 2-1/2 hours prior to entry interface
some considerably in advance of what would transpire if we
had a normal mission. The batteries are normally brought on
the line about 30 minutes prior to entry interface. Right
now our clock is counting down to lunar module jettison. And
we show a time of 2 hours 17 minutes from this time. We're
at 139 hours 23 minutes and this is Apollo Control Houston.
CAPCOM Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?
SC
I read you loud and clear.
CAP COM Okay. What we'd like to do, Jim is, we'll
go ahead and get the course alined for the gimbal angles
that you're going to be holding course, and we'll get the
platform up, and then when you call P52 and you sue it probably

APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-17-70 CST 8:31A GET 135:18:20 607/2
CAPCOM won't be close enough to put the star in
the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a bright star
in the general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the center
of the telescope so you have some clue as to which way to go
then the identification problem shouldn't present much of a
difficulty. Once you get the thing in the sextant, then you
can go ahead and treat it like any other single burn.
SC
That sounds great, one little problem, there
are some little fluffy white objects floating around and
also that (garble) part of Aquarius is just reflecting light
like

- and also that the jet's tearing at
the bottom of aquarius is just reflecting light like mad. We're
going to try. There's no problem there; if we can see it,
we'll get it.
CAPCOM Okay, and in the event that that doesn't
work, we're standing by with the original scheme a set of
LM FDAI angles to fly to that will point the LM module optics
st the Moon and the Sun; so we can always go back to that.
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM And, Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you
to verify the suit relief valve to CLOSED. Over.
SC
Stand by.
SC
It's closed.
CAPCOM
Okay.
SC
Okay, Houston, Aquarius.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
SC
We'll go with your original 91 degree
angle, if you have the stars figured out and the course aline
angle for us.
CAP COM Okay. Roger that, Jim. In a minute,
at your convenience here, we'd like you to go to that attitude
as close as you can get and call up the NOUN 20 for us.
SC
Okay, at work now.
CAPCOM
Okay.
SC
Houston, Aquarius.
CAPCOM
Go ahead, Aquarius.
SC
Okay, I take it that if Jack cannot
see stars at this attitude after you give the the course aline
angles, we've just got to read down to you our gimbal angles
and let you figure out a target angle for Jack, or did you
want him to do a sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is that
correct?
CAP COM That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will
course aline at that attitude. This is what we're having you
maneuver to the to that attitude for. We're going to compute
course aline gimbal angles and pass them up to him and the first
thing he'll do when there, per his checklist, is to course
aline his platform. Then, he'll go to the P52, and if he
can't see stars, we will quickly pass up to you the - your
FDAI angles to put him in the Moon view attitude and he'll do
a P52 on the Moon and then have you maneuver to the Sun and
complete the P52 on the Sun.
SC
Okay, but I'm going to have to maneuver
to the Moon to help him out.
CAP COM Oh, that's affirmative. If he can't
see stars at the sep attitude that you'll be holding, you'll
have to maneuver to the Moon attitude then to the Sun attitude
for him.
CAPCOM
Aquarius, Houston.
SC
Go ahead.

--- PAGE 888 ---
APOLLO 13 MISSION COMMENTARY 4-17-70 CST 8:37A GET 139:24:40 608/2
CAPCOM Just like to mention that even if for
some reason we run out of time or something and don't complete
the Moon/Sun P52, Jack will have a platform course aline to
the entry REFSMAT which we feel will be plenty good enough.
SC
That's my feelings, too.
CAP COM
Okay.

This is Apollo Control, Houston,
139 hours 42 minutes now into the flight. Apollo 13 is
presently 25 227 nautical miles out from Earth, traveling at
a velocity of about 12 307 feet per second. As you heard the
earlier discussion, Jack Swigert having some difficulty seeing
stars through the command module optics. These sightings are
used as a reference in platform alinement - that's the computer
platform. The problem is caused by sunlight reflecting off
the surface of the lunar module and this reflection getting
into the optics and washing out the view of the stars. If
Command Module Pilot Swigert is unsuccessful in his star
sighting efforts, Jim Lovell will maneuver with the lunar
module to give him the opportunity to sight off the Sun and
Moon. We're at 139 hours 42 minutes and continuing to monitor.
This is Apollo Control, Houston.

Hello there, Houston.
CAPOCM
Hi. Jim, we - we've gone ahead and computed
the CSM course aline gimbal angles, based on your being
at the service module SEP attitude at the time that Jack
cranks up the computer and in course alines the IMU. That is,
we assume that you're going to be at Roll 0, Pitch 091, Yaw 0,

Jack Swigert reported a 220 alarm, this
indicating that the IMU is not alined. We're at 140 hours
45 minutes into the flight. We show Apollo 13 at 17 461 nautical
miles away at the present, now traveling at a speed of 14 552
feet per second. Apollo 13 now 54 minutes away from the time
of lunar module jettison. To dispose of Aquarius, the crew
inside the command module after installing the hatch will
vent the lunar module tunnel to 1-1/2 or 2 pounds giving a
DELTA pressure of 3 psi across the docking tunnel hacth.
This to insure a proper sealing. To jettison the lunar module
the pyros are fired aboard the command module and pressure in
the tunnell gives a separation velocity of some 2 feet per
second. The command module will do most of the moving at
this point because it will be the lighter of the 2 spacecraft.
Separation could be likened to the releasing of a baloon and
having air propel it along. We're at 140 hours 47 minutes now

tical miles from earth traveling at a speed of 14 629 feet

I'm worried about.

SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM
Roger if you concur, we would be in=
clined to recommend that you go to AGS for the maneuver cause
you'll have to be there later on anyway.
SC
Okay.
CAPCOM
And AGS pulse is the recommendation.
SC
We're having trouble maneuvering Joe
without getting it in gimbal lock.
CAP COM
Okay you can -
SC
You picked a lousey attitude though to
separate.
CAP COM
We apologize; just take your time; Jim,
we've got time now.
SC
Okay.
SC
Houston, why can't I stay in PGNS that
whole for the LM attitude hold?
CAP COM
Stand by on that Jim.
CAP COM
Aquarius Houston over.
SC
Go ahead.
CAP COM
Okay our recommendation is that you
stay in AGS for the LM jett simply because we've thought it
through; we've got the right dead bands set up; over.
SC
Okay. It's a lot easier for me to maneuver
in PGNS Joe than it is the AGS.
CAPCOM Yeah - you can maneuver in PGNS Jim; I'm
sorry, I thought you were talking about the apt hold and the
LM jett afterward. You can maneuver in PGNS if you want to.

We're ready to give gimbal lock; I have
the yaw at about - I'd say about almost 50 degrees.
CAP COM Roger that just stay out of gimbal
lock and the 45 degree isn't critical, the out of plane that
is.

Jack, let me mention something about
the hatch integrity check. You're going to vent the tunnel
until you get a 3 psi delta P. That should take 9 or
10 minutes and it's our firm feeling that you don't have to
wait another 10 minutes after that for a leak check. If it

3 doctors to an astronaut. And the first two flip samples,
the findings medically speaking will be flown off as soon
as possible, to the laboratories. I've been getting a look
from the hangar deck of the elevator, whose down from top
side. the elevator they use of course to transport the helicopters
from hangar deck to flight deck. Once they get down they 11 have
a fairly shot walk, maybe 30 or 40 yards over into the - an
opening leading up the medical facility. Sick bay, which may be a
misnomer in this case. It does not appear anybody is sick.
That's Captain Kerkemo I know that is. And of course there
will be some fast telephone calls we assume to some waiting
wives at home. I wouldn't be surprised to see those phones
ringing very shortly. There they go. Into the entrance of
the medical facility and that should be all we see of them
