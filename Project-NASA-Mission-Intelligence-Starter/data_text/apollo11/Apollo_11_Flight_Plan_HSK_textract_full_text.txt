his final version of the Apollo 11 Flight Plan is number four of a set sent
to Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, Canberra, Australia, for support
of the mission.
It is dated July 1, 1969 and was received at the station on July 11, just five days
before launch.
Honeysuckle Creek was one of NASA's three prime 26 metre dish tracking sites
(the others being Goldstone, California and Madrid, Spain).
This copy was designated for the Telemetry (TLM) and Computer sections.
It has been preserved by Honeysuckle Creek's Bryan Sullivan, and includes his
notations.
The Flight Plan was scanned, and this PDF file assembled, by Colin Mackellar
for www.honeysucklecreek.net, May 2014.
For authenticity, the pages have been assembled without rotation of those
pages where text and charts are sideways (they can be easily rotated in a PDF
viewer). Page 1-7 is a foldout chart. Blank pages have also been retained.

INTRODUCTION
This Flight Plan has been prepared by the Flight Planning Branch, Flight
Crew Support Division, with technical support by TRW Systems.
This document schedules the AS-506/CSM-107/LM-5 operations and crew activities
to fulfill, when possible, the test objectives defined in the Mission Re-
quirements, G Type Mission Lunar Landing.
The trajectory parameters used in this Flight Plan are for July 16, 1969
launch, with a 72° launch azimuth and were supplied by Mission Planning and
Analysis Division as defined by the Apollo Mission G Spacecraft Operational
Trajectory.
The Apollo 11 Flight Plan is under the configuration control of the Crew
Procedures Control Board (CPCB). All proposed changes to this document
that fall in the following categories should be submitted to the CPCB via
a Crew Procedures Change Request:
1. Items that impose additional crew training or impact crew procedures.
2. Items that impact the accomplishment of detailed test objectives.
3. Items that result in a significant RCS or EPS budget change.
4. Items that result in moving major activities to a different activity
day in the Flight Plan.
5. Items that require a change to the flight data file.
The Chief, Flight Planning Branch (FCSD) will determine what proposed changes
fall in the above categories.
Mr. T. A. Guillory will act as co-ordinator for all proposed changes to
the Apollo 11 Flight Plan.
Any requests for additional copies or changes to the distribution lists of
this document must be made in writing to Mr. W. J. North, Chief, Flight Crew
Support Division, MSC, Houston, Texas.

5. Two crew status reports via air-to-ground communications will be
made by the flight crew during each activity day. The first re-
port will be given after the first meal of the day and will con-
cern the sleep obtained during the previous sleep period. The
second report will be given following the final meal of the day
and will concern the radiation dose received during the previous
24 hours and medication taken if any. The following information
should be logged:
a. Food Consumption
b. Exercise
C. Used fecal bags marked as to crewman and GET
6. Negative reporting will be used in reporting completion of each
checklist.
7. Continuous CSM biomedical data are automatically transmitted to the
ground.
8. LM biomedical switching is performed manually by the LMP from undock-
ing to docking as scheduled in the timeline.
9. All onboard gage readings will be read directly from the gages.
and will not be corrected by the appropriate calibration factors.
B. Photography
Photographic requirements were derived from the following:
a. Lunar Surface Operations Plan
b. Photographic Operations Plan

D. Communications
1. General
a. CSM and LM HBR data transmissions in lunar orbit will normal-
ly require the use of the high gain or steerable antennas
b. During communications, the spacecraft will be referred to
by name (Apollo 11) and MCC-H will be referred to as Houston.
C. The preferred S-Band communications are:
(1) CSM
(a) Uplink Mode 6 (Voice, PRN, and Updata)
(b) Downlink Mode 2 (Voice, PRN, TLM-HBR)
(2) LM
(a) Uplink Mode 7 (Voice, Updata)
(b) Downlink Mode 1 (Voice, TLM-HBR)
d. LM voice recorder has a maximum utilization of 10 hours. This
recorder will be used during LM operations to record all LM
voice data during undocked operations (27 hours 42 minutes).
This recorder will be operated in the VOX mode.
e. A small portable voice recorder will be carried in the CM to
be used at the discretion of the crew as a voice recorder back-
up. This recorder will not be transferred to the LM for use
during undocked operations.
f. The S-band' 'squelch" will be on during the sleep periods in or-
der to prevent MSFN fade-out noise from disturbing the crew.
2. DSE Operation
a. The DSE will normally be operated via ground command except for
special cases where the operation is time limited. In these cases
the crew may be asked to rewind the tape.
b. During the earth orbit period when the CSM is not over a MSFN
station, CSM TLM-LBR data will be recorded on the DSE and will be
dumped during the pass over the US and over CRO prior to TLI if
possible.
C. DSE will be used for CSM HBR and voice recording during all CSM
engine burns.
d. DSE data and voice recordings will be made in CSM LBR mode
whenver possible in order to minimize the DSE dump time.
1-15

--- PAGE 38 ---
e. During PTC using the HGA REACQ communications mode the DSE
will be used to record LBR data when the HGA is not in the
MSFN field of view.
f. During lunar orbit LM operations, the DSE will be used to record
LM-TLM-LBR data during all docked LM activites that occur on the
lunar farside. For undocked LM activites only DOI will be record-
ed as VHF ranging is required.
g. DSE will be used to record all HBR entry data during the blackout
region.
3. Launch Earth Orbit Phase
a. OMNI B and VHF LEFT will be selected for lift off. OMNI D will
be selected by the crew during boost phase if the launch azimuth
is less than 96° or OMNI C if the launch azimuth is greater than
96°. OMNI D will probably be the best antenna for earth orbit.
b. VHF Duplex B will be used for launch, and Simplex A for earth
orbit operations.
C. VHF Simplex A will be used for entry to be compatible with
recovery forces communications.
4. Translunar and Transearth Coast Phase
The translunar and transearth sleep communications mode will be as
follows. The CSM x-axis will be placed normal to the ecliptic
plane. The CSM will be rolled at a rate of approximately three
revolution per hour. During the near earth sleep periods prior
to 30 hours GET (range less than 120Knm) omni antennas B and D
will be used. During the other sleep periods (beyond 120Knm)
the high gain antenna may be required (in the REACQ mode). The
REACQ configuration will provide approximately 210 degrees of HGA
coverage per CSM/LM revolution or 35 minutes of MSFN coverage per
hour. The REACQ configuration will also allow MCC-H to use real
time control to select TLM HBR or LBR and to dump the DSE during
each spacecraft revolution.
5. Lunar Exploration Phase
a. Normal CSM communications between MSFN/LM will be by S-Band
during the lunar exploration period.
b. If additional communications capability is required the
S-Band erectable antenna will be deployed by the EVA crewman
and will be utilized for all LM/MSFN/CSM communications.
C. During periods when both crewmen are EVA, the "AR" position
(Relay Mode) will be the normal communication mode on each of
the Extravehicular Communication System (EVCS). The CDR
will relay the LMP VHF voice and data to the LM which in
turn will relay to MCC-H via S-Band.

CSM Notes
1. Electrical Power System and Water Management
a. Spacecraft lift-off switch positions are listed in the Apollo
Operations Handbook (Volume 2) for CSM 107.
b. The CSM will remain fully powered up throughout the mission
(CMC, IMU and SCS in the "operate" configuration and optics
power-up as required).
C. Fuel cell H2 and 02 purging is scheduled as follows H2 approx-
imately every 48 hours and 02 approximately every 12 hours.
d. The hydrogen and oxygen VAC ION pumps will be inactive through-
out the mission.
e. Potable water will be chlorinated once a day before each sleep
period, starting with the First sleep period (GET 13:30).
The POT H20 inlet valve will be opened prelaunch.
f. FC purges and waste water dumps will not be scheduled within
one hour prior to optical sightings.
g. Waste H20 dumping will be managed to allow:
(1) Maximum QTY:85-90%
(2) Minimum QTY:25%
(3) At LOI:QTY = 75%
(4) At CM-SM SEP:QTY = 90% to 100%
(5) No dumping after MCC3 until after LOI
(6) Dumps will be performed (if required) within 2 hours pre-
ceding MCC maneuvers
(7) In lunar orbit if dumping is required, dumps will be per-
formed immediately prior to sleep periods
(8) The water dump will not be operated in the automatic mode
at anytime during the mission
h. The cryogenic heaters will be in AUTO during the mission and
the fans will be operated manually. The fans will be cycled
for one minute before and after each sleep cycle.
i. The batteries will be charged according to the following
schedule:
Time
Battery
5:20:00
B
12:20:00
A
48:10:00
B
80:25:00
A
103:30:00
B
148:00:00
A
154:00:00

2. Environmental Control System and Cabin Pressurization
a. One C02 odor absorber filter (LiOH canister) is changed
approximately every 12 hours or if C02 partial pressure is
greater than 7.6mm Hg. There are 20 filters (2 in the
canisters onboard and 18 stowed).
1-17

--- PAGE 40 ---
b. The coolant loop operation will be as follows:
(1) Launch - primary loop operation
(2) Earth Orbit - primary loop operation and secondary
loop test
(3) Post TLI - deactivate both evaporators
(4) Pre LOI sec rad leak ck only.
(5) At 112:30 activate primary evaporator
(6) Post TEI - deactivate primary evaporator
(7) Entry interface minus 1 hour - activate primary and
secondary evaporator.
3. Guidance and Navigation
a. During lunar orbit, the CSM and LM
will utilize the same landing site
REFSMMAT such that the gimbal angles
would be 0,0,0 at landing with the
LM sitting face forward on landing
site number two and the CSM over
the landing site pitched up 90°
from local horizontal "heads up".
b. During PTC the CSM/LM x-axis is pitched up 90° (North)
for TLC and down 90° (South) for TEC with the Y-Z axes
in the plane of the ecliptic. This change in x-axis
pointing is to enable simultaneous viewing of the earth
and moon through the side windows while maintaining a
favorable high gain antenna position.
C. The CSM tracking light will be on continuously from undock-
ing to landing and from LM lift-off to docking.
4. Landmark Tracking
The following ground rules were used for landmark tracking.
a. IMU to be realigned on the dark side preceding each track-
ing period.
b. MSFN is reacquired after each tracking period. The
tracking data will be acquired by MSFN after all the
marks have been made and while N49 (AR,AV) is displayed.
MSFN will give a GO when data acquisition has been verified.
C. The pseudo landmark tracking (A1) will be used to determine
the altitude of an area in which the LM will be making al-
titude checks after DOI. The data will be processed during
the sleep period after the trackings and relayed to the LM
prior to undocking.
1-18
Revision A

--- PAGE 41 ---
2°
d. In the docked configuration the CSM/LM
approaches the landmark in an inertial
hold attitude. This inertial attitude
places the spacecraft 2° below the
local horizontal at the 35° elevation
35°
angle point. At 35° elevation angle a
pitch down of 0.3°/sec is initiated.
Five marks are then taken with the
time between marks a minimum of 25
seconds. (See tracking profile)
e. In the undocked configuration the CSM
approaches the landmark in ORB RATE and
22°
pitched down 22° from the local horizon-
tal. At 35° elevation angle five marks
35°
are taken with the time between marks a
minimum of 25 seconds. ORB RATE is
continued throughout the marking period.
f. In the undocked COAS tracking the CSM
will approach the LM in ORB RATE heads
up and pitched down 40° from the local
horizontal. When the LM is centered
in the COAS the CSM will initiate a
40°
variable pitch rate to keep the LM
centered in the COAS.
5. CSM/LM and CSM attitude maneuvers will normally be at a rate
of 0.2°/sec or 0.5°/sec. unless other rates are required.
NOTE: At 0.2°/sec, 15 minutes is required to maneuver 180°.
At 0.5°/sec, 6 minutes is required to maneuver 180°.
6. Passive thermal control mode will be initiated after MCC1 or
as soon as MCC1 is scrubbed and maintained throughout the
mission (except in lunar orbit) until at least three hours
before entry except for interruptions for midcourse corrections,
communications orientation (maximum interruption of three
hours). PTC will not be initiated before approximately 7:00
GET.
7. Service Propulsion System All SPS burns will be initiated
on Bank A except LOIT which will be initiated on Bank B.
F.
LM Notes
1. Entries into the LM
a. Three entries into the LM are scheduled in the timeline
at 56:30, 81:30 and 95:52 GET respectively.
1-19

--- PAGE 42 ---
b. The first entry (56:30 GET) will be for LM familiarization
and will be performed by the CDR and LMP in the constant
wear garments. During this period there will be approxi-
mately 5 minutes of VHF-B LBR data which will be recorded
by the DSE in the CSM. The LM will remain on CSM power
during the crew familiarization period.
C. The second entry (81:30 GET) will be for LM housekeeping
and will be performed by the LMP in constant wear garments.
During this period the LM will go to internal power for the
S-Band/VHF B voice activation.
d. The third entry into the LM (95:52 GET) will be performed
by the LMP in LCG's to prepare the LM for undocking and
descent to the lunar surface. During this period the LMP
and CDR initially transfer to the LM in LCG's then return
to the CSM for PGA donning.
2. Environmental Control System and Cabin Pressurization
a. The LM cabin will contain ambient air at lift off and will
bleed down to zero pressure psi during the launch.
b. The LM will be pressurized for transposition and docking
after which it will be isolated and the pressure periodically
monitored.
C. The LM will be pressurized prior to the first entry (LM
familiarization) after which it will be isolated again
for the remainder of the TLC period.
d. Prior to the second entry (LM housekeeping) it will be
pressurized again and will remain pressurized.
3. Guidance and Navigation
a. Two LGC erasable memory dumps and MCC-H verifications will
be accomplished prior to DOI. If a significant number of
errors are found, memory correction and re-verification
will be performed before DOI.
b. The LM IMU will be manually aligned to the CSM IMU during
the DOI Day LM activation and checkout. P52/AOT alignments
will be performed as close to DOI as possible.
C. All translations during the undocked manned LM operations will
be under PGNCS control.
d. The capability for MCC-H to update the LGC via uplink will
normally be blocked by the LMP UP-DATA LINK switch (panel 12).
1-20

--- PAGE 43 ---
4. RCS Operation and Interface Constraints
a. During CSM/LM docked checkout operations, the LM steerable
and/or RR antennas will not be powered down once they have
been activated. The SM B3 and C4 thrusters will be
deactivated before the LM steerable and/or RR antennas have
been unstowed in order to prevent SM-RCS impingement on these
antennas.
b. The CSM roll jets and LM yaw jets will be disabled when the
probe is preloaded (docking latches are cocked) and the tunnel
is pressurized prior to undocking. The jets will be activated
after tunnel venting.
C. LM RCS two jet ullage (System B) will be used for unstaged
ullage maneuvers in order to prevent asymetrical RCS thrust
caused by impingement on the descent stage.
d. The RCS interconnect will be used during the APS lift-off
and ascent, but will not be used during the rendezvous maneuvers.
5. Rendezvous
a. The rendezvous radar will be pointed away from the sun
and will be turned off when no functional use is required
to prevent overheating of the antenna.
b. The LM tracking light will be on continuously between
separation and touchdown and between launch and docking ex-
cept during PGNCS/AOT alignments. During PGNCS/AOT align-
ments (LM P52), the tracking light would interfere with the
alignments. (dark adaption)

SECTION 4
DETAILED OBJECTIVE ACTIVITIES
This section contains the activity summaries which reflect the test
objectives for Mission G as described in "Mission Requirements G Type Mission",
SPD9-R-038, Change A dated May 1, 1969. These activity summaries are presented in
the approximate sequence in which they are planned to occur during the mission.
Each activity summary provides the following information:
A. TEST OBJECTIVES. This is the listing of the Functional Test
Objectives (complete or partial) which relate to the
particular activity;
B. TEST REQUIREMENTS. Here the special test prerequisites (and
mission phase if necessary) are presented in addition to brief
statements of the requirements for performing the activity;
C. TEST PROCEDURES/CHECKLISTS. These are the procedural
references for the performance of the activity as far as
the test objectives are concerned; and
D. DATA REQUIREMENTS. This part of the summary identifies the
gross data which are needed for evaluation of test results
in terms of flight crew and ground support requirements.
Cross references for relating Detailed and Functional Test Objectives with
the activity summaries and relating activities to Functional Test Objectives, are
provided as the initial part of this section.
The following ground rules are to be used in implementing data requirements:
A. The collection of highly desirable (HD) data should not constrain
the timeline of the crew procedures.
B. Post-flight debriefing requirements which are fulfilled by real time
transmission of data per the DATA REQUIREMENTS sections may be deleted
from the post-flight debriefing.
All of the Test Requirements have not been totally implemented into the
mission timeline. These items are identified in this section as "Not Implemented"
or with the conditions by which they will be implemented.

SM-RCS BUDGET
GROUND RULES and ASSUMPTIONS
1. The transposition and docking phase of the mission includes
an SPS evasive maneuver.
2. The first and third midcourse corrections (translunar) are
executed as SPS burns with the third MCC followed by an RCS trim.
3. No SM RCS propellant is required during PTC or lunar orbit
coast.
4. The sixth midcourse correction (transearth) is executed as
an RCS burn of 5 fps.
5. The individual quad plots are included for reference only
as quad management is determined by the flight controllers during
the mission.

SERVICE PROPULSION SYSTEM
SERVICE PROPULSION SYSTEM (SPS). - The budget presented in table 5-4
is for a July 16 launch, 72 degree launch azimuth, first opportunity in-
jection, 59.5 hour lunar parking orbit, and fast earth return. The assump-
tions used in preparing this budget are presented in table 5-5. AV requirements
were coordinated with LMAB in MPAD.
It should be noted that the mission flexibility allowance of 900 fps has been
used in addition to the fast return. In real time however, it is highly likely
that a slower earth return would be performed in the mission flexibility AV
had already been used (e.g., for LM rescue). Table 5-4 shows 3906 lbs of pro-
pellant remaining nominally and a total propellant margin (accounting both for
the flexibility AV and the fast return) of 1268 lb.

TABLE 5-5 — ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE APOLLO 11 SPS PROPELLANT BUDGET
1. There is a non-propulsive propellant loss of 14.4 lb for each engine
start. LM rescue assumed three engine starts.
2. A mission flexibility AV of 900 fps has been included in the SPS
budget to provide the capability to perform a worst case LM rescue,
or to handle several other contingencies (such as loss of PGNCS),
or to perform a quicker earth return.

LM RCS BUDGET
Ground Rules and Assumptions
1. Data for the LM RCS engine performance and propellant requirements
were obtained from the Spacecraft Operational Data Book and postflight
analysis from Apollo 9 and Apollo 10.
2. All orientation maneuvers were assumed to be made at 2.0 °/sec.
3. All orientation maneuvers were assumed to be three-axis maneuvers.

DESCENT PROPULSION SYSTEM PROPELLANT BUDGET
Descent Propulsion Subsystem (DPS) - The DPS budget is shown in table 5-8
and the ground rules and assumptions in table 5-9.
Previously, the uncertainty in the low-level sensor (68.7 lb) has been shown
as a contingency allowance. This is now included as part of the unusables.
Also, there has previously been a contingency allowance for manual hover to
allow for 2 minutes of burn time from 500 feet to touchdown. The present
budget shows a nominal V which includes a manual allowance of 477 fps (90
sec) from 500 feet to touchdown. Any additional hover time will be used
from the propellant margin (unassigned capability). The rate of use for
hover is approximately 9.1 lb/sec.
Propellant loads are those actually loaded on LM-5, and trapped and residual
propellants are from Volume III, SODB. Engine performance data and AV re-
quirements have been coordinated with LAB in MPAD.
Three sigma dispersions represent total propellant cost due to 30 uncertainties
in propellant loading, trapped, ISP, , separation weight, non-V consumables
weight, and mixture ratio. There is a total propellant margin of 669 lb or
approximately 73 seconds of hover time.

table 5-10 accounts for an engine valve-pair malfunction, a PGNCS to AGS switch-
over, and a touchdown abort. There is a total propellant margin of 68 lb or
about 6 seconds of burn time.

uprated to 45 A-h.
5. Two batteries were considered to be in parallel with the fuel
cells during ascent and for each SPS maneuver.
6. No cryogenic venting was assumed in flight.
7. The EPS hydrogen consumption rate (1b/hr) = 0.00257 X I fc
8. The EPS oxygen consumption rate (1b/hr) = 7.936 X H2
9. Six battery charges were assumed: three on battery A and three
on battery B.
