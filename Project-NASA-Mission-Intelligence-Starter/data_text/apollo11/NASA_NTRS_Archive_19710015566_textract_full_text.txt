PREFACE
On May 25, 1961, this nation made a commitment:
to land men on the Moon before the end of the decade.
On July 20, 1969, the commitment was met. American
astronauts left the following message on the lunar sur-
face: "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot
upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for
all mankind."
The achievement belongs to all mankind. But those
that made it possible deserve our special thanks.
First, there are three especially brave men -- Neil
Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. They were
backed up by thousands of men and women in NASA, in
other government agencies, in industry and in uni-
versities, and in the Congress. All of them were
dedicated to the cause of Apollo, and they proved that
with skill and the desire to succeed -- above all, with
dedication -- we as a nation can indeed meet the most
difficult tasks we set for ourselves.

1. SUMMARY
The purpose of the Apollo 11 mission was to land men on the lunar surface and to
return them safely to earth. The members of the crew were Neil A. Armstrong, Commander;
Michael Collins, Command Module Pilot; and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., Lunar Module Pilot.
The space vehicle was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 8:32:00 a.m.
e.s.t., July 16, 1969. The activities during earth orbit checkout, translunar injection,
transposition and docking, spacecraft ejection, and translunar coast were similar to
those of the previous mission, a lunar orbit rendezvous flight. Only one midcourse
correction, performed at approximately 27 hours g.e.t., was required during translunar
coast.
The spacecraft was inserted into lunar orbit at approximately 76 hours g.e.t., and
the circularization maneuver was performed two revolutions later. Initial checkout of
the lunar module systems was satisfactory, and after a planned rest period, the Commander
and Lunar Module Pilot entered the lunar module to prepare for descent.
The two spacecraft were undocked at approximately 100 hours g.e.t., followed by
separation of the command and service modules from the lunar module. Descent orbit in-
sertion was performed at approximately 101-1/2 hours g.e.t., and powered descent to the
lunar surface began approximately 1 hour later. Operation of the guidance and descent
propulsion systems was nominal. The lunar module was maneuvered manually to a landing
approximately 1100 feet down range from the nominal landing point during the final
2-1/2 minutes of descent. The spacecraft landed in the Sea of Tranquility at
102:45:40 g.e.t. The landing coordinates were latitude 0°41'15" N and longitude 23°26' E.
During the first 2 hours on the lunar surface, the two crewmen performed a postlanding
checkout of all lunar module systems. Afterward, they ate their first meal on the moon
and elected to perform the surface operations earlier than planned.
Considerable time was deliberately devoted to checkout and donning of the back-
mounted portable life support and oxygen purge systems. The Commander egressed through
the forward hatch and deployed an equipment module in the descent stage. A camera in
this module provided live television coverage of the Commander descending the ladder to
the surface, with first contact made at 109:24:15 g.e.t. (9:56:15 p.m. e.s.t., July 20,
1969). The Lunar Module Pilot egressed soon thereafter, and both crewmen used the ini-
tial period on the surface to become acclimated to the reduced gravity and unfamiliar
surface conditions. A contingency sample was taken from the surface, and the television
camera was deployed so that most of the lunar module was included in its view field.
The crew activated the scientific experiments, which included a solar wind detector, a
passive seismometer, and a laser retroreflector. The Lunar Module Pilot evaluated his
ability to operate and move about and was able to translate rapidly and with confidence.
Forty-seven pounds of lunar surface material were collected to be returned for analysis.
The surface exploration was concluded in the allotted time of 2-1/2 hours, and the crew
reentered the lunar module at 111-1/2 hours g.e.t.
Ascent preparation was conducted efficiently, and the ascent stage lifted off the
surface at 124-1/4 hours g.e.t. A nominal firing of the ascent engine placed the vehicle
into a 48- by 9-mile orbit. After a rendezvous sequence similar to that of Apollo 10,
the two spacecraft were docked at 128 hours g.e.t. Following transfer of the crew, the
ascent stage was jettisoned, and the command and service modules were prepared for trans-
earth injection.
The return flight started with a 150-second firing of the service propulsion engine
during the 31st lunar revolution at 135-1/2 hours g.e.t. As in the translunar flight,
only one midcourse correction was required, and passive thermal control was exercised

--- PAGE 14 ---
for most of the transearth coast. Inclement weather necessitated moving the landing
point 215 miles down range. The entry phase was normal, and the command module landed
in the Pacific Ocean at 195-1/4 hours g.e.t. The landing coordinates, as determined
from the onboard computer, were latitude 13°19' N and longitude 169°09' W.
After landing, the crew donned biological isolation garments. The crew was then
retrieved by helicopter and taken to the primary recovery ship, U.S.S. Hornet. The crew
and the lunar material samples were placed in the Mobile Quarantine Facility for trans-
port to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston, Texas. The command module was taken
aboard the U.S.S. Hornet approximately 3 hours after landing.
With the completion of the Apollo 11 mission, the national objective, landing men
on the moon and returning them safely to earth before the end of the decade, had been
accomplished.
2. INTRODUCTION
The Apollo 11 mission was the 11th in a series of flights using Apollo flight hard-
ware and was the first lunar landing mission of the Apollo Program. It was also the fifth
manned flight of the command and service modules and the third manned flight of the lunar
module. The purpose of the mission was to perform a manned lunar landing and to return
the men safely to earth. A history of the Apollo flights is presented in appendix A.
Because of the excellent performance of the entire spacecraft, only the systems per-
formance that significantly differed from that of previous missions is reported. The
ascent, descent, and landing portions of the mission are reported in section 5, and the
lunar surface activities are reported in section 11.
In this report, all actual times are given as elapsed time from range zero (g.e.t.),
which is established as the integral second before lift-off. Range zero for this mission
was 13:32:00 G.m.t., July 16, 1969. All references to mileage distance are in nautical
miles.
3. MISSION DESCRIPTION
The Apollo 11 mission accomplished the basic mission of the Apollo Program, that
is, to land two men on the lunar surface and return them safely to earth. As a part of
this first lunar landing, three basic experiment packages were deployed, lunar material
samples were collected, and surface photographs were taken. Two of the experiments were
a part of the early Apollo scientific experiment package that was developed for deploy-
ment on the lunar surface. The sequence of events and the flight plan of the Apollo 11
mission are shown in table 3-I and figure 3-1, respectively.
The Apollo 11 space vehicle was launched on July 16, 1969, at 8:32 a.m. e.s.t., as
planned. The spacecraft and the S-IVB were inserted into a 100.7- by 99.2-mile earth
parking orbit. After a 2-1/2-hour checkout period, the spacecraft/S-IVB combination was
injected into the translunar phase of the mission. Trajectory parameters after the
translunar injection firing were nearly perfect, with the velocity within 1.6 ft/sec of
that planned. Only one of the four options for midcourse corrections during the trans-
lunar phase was exercised. This correction, which was made with the service propulsion
system at approximately 26-1/2 hours, provided a 20.9-ft/sec velocity change. During
the remaining periods of free-attitude flight, passive thermal control was used to
maintain spacecraft temperatures within desired limits. The Commander and Lunar Module
Pilot transferred to the lunar module during the translunar phase to make an initial
inspection and to prepare the lunar module for a systems check in lunar orbit.
2

--- PAGE 15 ---
The spacecraft was inserted into a 60- by 169.7-mile lunar orbit at approximately
76 hours. Four hours later, a lunar orbit circularization maneuver was performed to
place the spacecraft in a 65.7- by 53.8-mile orbit. The Lunar Module Pilot entered the
lunar module at approximately 81 hours for the initial power-up and systems checks.
After the planned sleep period was completed at 93-1/2 hours, the crew donned their
suits, transferred to the lunar module, and made final preparations for descent to the
lunar surface. The lunar module was undocked on time at approximately 100 hours. After
the exterior of the lunar module had been inspected from the command module, a
separation maneuver was performed with the service module reaction control system.
A descent orbit insertion maneuver was performed by the descent propulsion system
at 101-1/2 hours. Trajectory parameters following this maneuver were as planned, and
powered descent initiation was on time at 102-1/2 hours. The descent maneuver lasted
approximately 12 minutes, with engine shutdown occurring almost simultaneously with
touchdown in the Sea of Tranquility. The coordinates of the actual landing point were
latitude 0°41'15" N and longitude 23°26' E, compared with the planned landing point of
latitude 0°43'53" N and longitude 23°38'51" E. These coordinates are referenced to
Lunar Map ORD-II-6(100), first edition, dated December 1967.
A 2-hour postlanding checkout was completed, followed by a partial power-down of
the spacecraft. A crew rest period was planned to precede the extravehicular activity
for exploration of the lunar surface. However, the crew elected to perform the extra-
vehicular portion of the mission prior to the sleep period because they were not overly
tired and were adjusting easily to the 1/6-g environment. After the crew donned their
portable life support systems and completed the required checkouts, the Commander
egressed at approximately 109 hours. Prior to descending the ladder, the Commander de-
ployed an equipment module in the descent stage. The television camera located in the
equipment module operated satisfactorily and provided live television coverage of the
Commander's descent to the lunar surface. The Commander collected the contingency lunar
material samples. Approximately 20 minutes later, the Lunar Module Pilot egressed, and
dual exploration of the lunar surface began.
During the exploration period, the television camera was deployed, and the
American flag was raised on the lunar surface. The solar wind experiment also was
deployed for later retrieval. Both crewmen evaluated their mobility on the lunar sur-
face, deployed the passive seismic and laser retroreflector experiments, collected
approximately 47 pounds of lunar material, and obtained photographic documentation of
their activities and the conditions around them. The crewmen reentered the lunar module
after approximately 2 hours 14 minutes of exploration.
After an 8-hour rest period, the crew began preparations for ascent. Lift-off from
the lunar surface occurred on time at 124:22:00.8. The spacecraft was inserted into a
48.0- by 9.4-mile orbit, from which a rendezvous sequence similar to that for the
previous mission was successfully performed.
Approximately 4-1/2 hours after lunar module ascent, the command and service mod-
ules completed a docking maneuver. The ascent stage was jettisoned in lunar orbit,
and the command and service modules were prepared for transearth injection at
135-1/2 hours.
The activities during transearth coast were similar to those during translunar
flight. The service module was separated from the command module 15 minutes before
reaching the entry interface altitude of 400 000 feet. After an automatic entry se-
quence and landing system deployment, the command module landed in the Pacific Ocean
at 195-1/2 hours. The postlanding procedures that involved the primary recovery ship
U.S.S. Hornet included precautions to avoid back-contamination by any lunar organisms,
and the crew and samples were placed in quarantine.

--- PAGE 16 ---
After reaching the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, the spacecraft, crew, and samples
entered the Lunar Receiving Laboratory quarantine area for continuation of the post-
landing observation and analyses. No evidence of abnormal medical reactions was ob-
served, and the crew and spacecraft were released from quarantine on August 10, 1969.

4. PILOTS' REPORT
Prelaunch Activities
All prelaunch systems operations and checks were completed on time and without dif-
ficulty. The configuration of the environmental control system included operation of the
secondary glycol loop and provided comfortable cockpit temperature conditions.
Launch
Lift-off occurred precisely on time with ignition accompanied by a low rumbling noise
and moderate vibration that increased significantly at the moment of holddown release.
The vibration magnitudes decreased appreciably at the time tower clearance was verified.
The yaw, pitch, and roll guidance-program sequences occurred as expected. No unusual
sounds or vibrations were noted during passage through the region of maximum dynamic
pressure, and the angle of attack remained near zero. The S-IC/S-II staging sequence
occurred smoothly and at the expected time.
The entire S-II stage flight was remarkably smooth and quiet, and the launch escape
tower and boost protective cover were jettisoned normally. The mixture-ratio shift of
the J2 engine in the S-II stage was accompanied by a noticeable acceleration decrease.
The S-II/S-IVB staging sequence occurred smoothly and approximately at the predicted
time. The S-IVB insertion trajectory was completed without incident, and the automatic
guidance shutdown yielded an insertion-orbit ephemeris, from the command module com-
puter, of 102.1 by 103.9 miles. Communications between the crewmembers and the Manned
Space Flight Network were excellent throughout all launch stages.
Earth Orbit Coast and Translunar Injection
The insertion checklist was completed, and a series of spacecraft systems checks
disclosed no abnormalities. All tests of the navigation equipment, including alinements
and drift checks, were satisfactory. The service module reaction control thrusters were
fired in the minimum-impulse mode and were verified by telemetry.
No abnormalities were noted during preparation for translunar injection. Initiation
of translunar injection was accompanied by the proper onboard indications, and the S-IVB
propellant tanks were repressurized on schedule.
The S-IVB stage reignited on time at 2:44:16 without ignition or guidance transients.
An apparent 0.5° to 1.5° pitch-attitude error on the attitude indicators was not con-
firmed by the command module computer, which indicated that the attitude and the attitude
rate duplicated the reference trajectory precisely. (See "Guidance, Navigation, and Con-
trol" in section 8.) The guided cut-off yielded a velocity very close to that expected,
as indicated by the onboard computer. The entry monitor system further confirmed that
the forward velocity error for the translunar injection maneuver was within 3.3 ft/sec.
Transposition and Docking
The digital autopilot was used for the transposition maneuver scheduled to begin
20 seconds after spacecraft separation from the S-IVB. The time delay was to allow the
command and service modules to drift approximately 70 feet prior to thrusting back toward
the S-IVB. The separation and the beginning of transposition were on time. To assure a
pitchup maneuver for better visibility through the hatch window, pitch axis control was
retained in a manual mode until after a pitchup rate of approximately 1 deg/sec was
15

--- PAGE 28 ---
attained. Control was then given to the digital autopilot to continue the combined
pitch/roll maneuver. However, the autopilot stopped pitching up at this point, and it
was necessary to reestablish manual control. (See "Guidance, Navigation, and Control"
in section 8 for more discussion of the autopilot.) This control cycle was repeated
several times before the autopilot continued the transposition maneuver. Consequently,
additional time and reaction control fuel (18 pounds above the preflight nominal) were
required, and the spacecraft reached a maximum separation distance of at least 100 feet
from the S-IVB.
The subsequent closing maneuvers were made normally under digital autopilot control
by using a 2-deg/sec rate and 0.5° deadband control mode. Contact was made at an esti-
mated 0.1 ft/sec, without side velocity, but with a small roll misalinement. Subsequent
tunnel inspection revealed a roll index angle of 2.0° and a contact mark on the drogue
4 inches long. Lunar module extraction was normal.
Translunar Coast
The S-IVB was targeted to achieve a translunar injection cut-off velocity 6.5 ft/sec
in excess of that required to place the spacecraft on the desired free-return trajectory.
This overspeed was then cancelled by a service propulsion correction of 20 ft/sec at
23 minutes after spacecraft ejection.
Two periods of cislunar midcourse navigation, using the command module computer pro-
gram (P23), were planned and executed. The first determination, at 6 hours, was primar-
ily to establish the apparent horizon altitude for optical marks in the computer. The
first determination was begun at a distance of approximately 30 000 miles; while the
second determination, at 24 hours, was designed to establish the optical bias errors
accurately. Excess time and fuel were expended during the first period because of dif-
ficulty in locating the substellar point of each star. Ground-supplied gimbal angles
were used rather than those from the onboard computer. This technique was devised be-
cause computer solutions are unconstrained about the optics shaft axis; therefore, the
computer is unable to predict if the lunar module structure might block the line of sight
to the star. The ground-supplied angles prevented the lunar module structure from OC-
culting the star, but were not accurate in locating the precise substellar point, as evi-
denced by the fact that the sextant reticle pattern was not parallel to the horizon.
Additional maneuvers were required to achieve a parallel reticle pattern near the point
of horizon-star superposition.
The second period of navigation measurements was less difficult, largely because
the earth appeared much smaller, and trim maneuvers to the substellar point could be
made much more quickly and economically.
The digital autopilot was used to initiate the passive thermal control mode at a
positive roll rate of 0.3 deg/sec, with the positive longitudinal axis of the spacecraft
pointed toward the ecliptic North Pole during translunar coast. (The ecliptic South Pole
was the direction used during transearth coast.) After the roll rate had been estab-
lished, thruster firing was prevented by turning off all 16 switches for the service
module thrusters. In general, this method was highly successful in that it maintained a
satisfactory spacecraft attitude for long periods of time and allowed the crew to sleep
without fear of either entering gimbal lock or encountering unacceptable thermal con-
ditions. However, a procedural refinement in the form of a new computer routine is re-
quired to make the operation foolproof from an operator's viewpoint. 1 On several occa-
sions and for several different reasons, an incorrect computer-entry procedure was used,
Editor's note: A new routine (routine 64) was available for Apollo 12.
16

--- PAGE 29 ---
resulting in a slight waste of reaction control propellants. Satisfactory platform
alinements (program P52, option 3) using the optics in the resolved mode and medium speed
were possible during rotation at 0.3 deg/sec.
Lunar Orbit Insertion
A 6-minute service propulsion maneuver was performed, and the spacecraft was inserted
into a 169.9- by 60.9-mile orbit, as determined by the onboard computer. Procedurally,
this firing was the same as all the other service propulsion maneuvers, except that it
was started by using the bank B propellant valves instead of the bank A valves. The
steering of the docked spacecraft was exceptionally smooth, and the control of the applied
velocity change was extremely accurate, as evidenced by the fact that residuals were only
0.1 ft/sec in all axes.
The circularization maneuver was targeted for a 66- by 54-mile orbit, a change from
the 60-mile circular orbit which had been executed in previous lunar flights. The firing
was normally accomplished by using the bank A propellant valves only, and the onboard
solution of the orbit was 66.1 by 54.4 miles. The ellipticity of this orbit was supposed
to disappear slowly because of irregularities in the lunar gravitational field, such that
the command module would be in a 60-mile circular orbit at the time of rendezvous. How-
ever, the onboard estimate of the orbit during the rendezvous was 63.2 by 56.8 miles,
indicating that the ellipticity decay rate was less than expected. As a result, the
rendezvous maneuver solutions differed from the preflight estimates.
Lunar Module Checkout
Two entries were made into the lunar module prior to the final activation on the day
of landing. The first entry was made at approximately 57 hours g.e.t. on the day before
lunar orbit insertion. Television and still cameras were used to document the hatch
probe and drogue removal and the initial entry into the lunar module. The command module
oxygen hoses were used to provide circulation in the lunar module cabin. A leisurely
inspection period confirmed the proper positioning of all circuit breaker and switch set-
tings and of all stowage items. All cameras were checked for proper operation.
Descent Preparation
Lunar module.- The crew was awakened according to the flight plan schedule. The
liquid cooling garments and biomedical harnesses were donned. In anticipation of the
donning, these items had been unstowed and prepositioned the evening before. Following
a hearty breakfast, the Lunar Module Pilot transferred into the lunar module to accomp-
lish initial activation before returning to the command module for suiting. This stag-
gered suiting sequence served to expedite the final checkout and resulted in only two
crewmembers being in the command module during each suiting operation.
The sequence of activities was essentially the same as that developed for Apollo 10,
with only minor refinements. Numerous Manned Space Flight Network simulations and train-
ing sessions, including suited operations of this mission phase, ensured the completion
of this exercise within the allotted time. As in all previous entries into the lunar
module, the repressurization valve produced a loud "bang" when it was positioned to CLOSE
or AUTO and when the cabin regulator was off. Transfer of power from the command module
to the lunar module and then electrical power system activation were completed on
schedule.
The primary glycol loop was activated approximately 30 minutes early, with a slow
but immediate decrease in glycol temperature. The activation continued to progress
17

--- PAGE 30 ---
smoothly 30 to 40 minutes ahead of schedule. With the Commander entering the lunar mod-
ule early, the Lunar Module Pilot had more than twice the normally allotted time to don
his pressure suit in the command module.
The early power-up of the lunar module computer and inertial measurement unit enabled
the ground to calculate the fine gyro torquing angles for alining the lunar module plat-
form to the command module platform before the loss of communications on the lunar far
side. This early alinement added more than an hour to the planned time available for
analyzing the drift of the lunar module guidance system.
After suiting, the Lunar Module Pilot entered the lunar module, the drogue and probe
were installed, and the hatch was closed. During the ascent-battery checkout, the vari-
ations in voltage produced a noticeable pitch and intensity variation in the already loud
noise of the glycol pump. Suit-loop pressure integrity and cabin regulator repressuri-
zation checks were accomplished without difficulty. Activation of the abort guidance
system produced only one minor anomaly. An illuminated portion of one of the data read-
out numerics failed, and this failure resulted in some ambiguity in data readout. (See
"Electroluminescent Segment on Display Inoperative" in section 16.)
Following command module landmark tracking, the lunar module was maneuvered to ob-
tain steerable antenna acquisition, and state vectors were uplinked into the primary
guidance computer. The landing-gear deployment was evidenced by a slight jolt to the
spacecraft. The reaction control system, the descent propulsion system, and the rendez-
vous radar system were activated and checked out. Required pressurization was con-
firmed both audibly and by instrument readout.
The abort guidance system calibration was accomplished at the preplanned spacecraft
attitude. As the command and service modules maneuvered both spacecraft to the undocking
attitude, a final switch and circuit breaker configuration check was accomplished, fol-
lowed by donning of helmets and gloves.
Command module.- Activities after lunar orbit circularization were routine, with the
time being used primarily for photographing the lunar surface. The activation of the
lunar module in preparation for descent was, from the viewpoint of the Command Module
Pilot, a well-organized and fairly leisurely period. During the abort guidance system
calibration, the command module was maintained at a fixed attitude for several minutes
without firing thrusters. It was easy to stabilize the spacecraft with minimum-impulse
control prior to the required period; therefore, no thruster firings were needed for at
least 10 minutes.
The probe, drogue, and hatch all functioned perfectly; and the operations of closing
out the tunnel, preloading the probe, and cocking the latches were done routinely. Pre-
vious practice with installation and removal of the probe and drogue during translunar
coast was most helpful.
Two periods of orbital navigation (program P22) were scheduled with the lunar module
attached. The first, at 83 hours, consisted of five marks on the Crater Kamp in the
Foaming Sea. The technique used was to approach the target area in an inertial attitude
hold mode, with the X-axis being roughly horizontal to the target when the spacecraft
reached an elevation angle of 35° from the target, at which point a pitch-down of approx-
imately 0.3 deg/sec was begun. This technique, which was necessary to assure a
2-1/2-minute mark period distributed evenly near the zenith, was performed without
difficulty.
The second navigation exercise was performed on the following day, shortly prior to
separation from the lunar module. A series of five marks was taken on a small crater on
the inner north wall of crater 130. The previously described technique was used, except
that two forward-firing thrusters (one yaw and one pitch) were inhibited to preclude
18

--- PAGE 31 ---
thrust impingement on the deployed rendezvous-radar and steerable antennas. The reduced
pitch authority doubled the time required (to approximately 3 seconds when using accel-
eration command) to achieve a 0.3-deg/sec pitch-down rate. Because the Command Module
Pilot was in the lower equipment bay, where rate instrumentation is not available, it
was necessary in both cases to achieve the pitch rate by timing the duration of
acceleration-command hand controller inputs.
To prevent the two spacecraft from slipping and hence upsetting the docked lunar
module platform alinement, roll thruster firings were inhibited after the probe preload
until the tunnel had been vented to approximately 1 psi. Only single roll jet authority
was used after the 1-psi point was reached and until the tunnel pressure became zero.
Undocking and Separation
Particular care was exercised in the operation of both spacecraft throughout the
undocking and separation sequences to ensure that the lunar module guidance computer
maintained an accurate knowledge of position and velocity.
The undocking action imparted a velocity of 0.4 ft/sec to the lunar module, as
measured by the lunar module primary guidance system. The abort guidance system dis-
agreed with the primary system by approximately 0.2 ft/sec, which is well within the
preflight limit. The velocity was nulled, since the primary system was assumed to be
correct. The command module undocking velocity was maintained until the desired inspec-
tion distance of 40 feet was reached. At this distance, the command module velocity was
visually nulled with respect to the lunar module.
A visual inspection by the Command Module Pilot during a lunar module 360° yaw ma-
neuver confirmed proper landing-gear extension. The lunar module maintained position
with respect to the command module at relative rates believed to be less than 0.1 ft/sec.
To enter the planned equiperiod separation orbit, the 2.5-ft/sec radially downward sep-
aration maneuver was performed at approximately 100-1/2 hours with the command and
service modules.
Lunar Module Descent
The first optical alinement of the inertial platform, in preparation for descent
orbit insertion, was accomplished shortly after entering darkness and following separa-
tion. The torquing angles were approximately 0.3°, indicating either an error in the
docked alinement or platform drift. A rendezvous-radar lock was achieved manually, and
the radar boresight coincided with that of the crew optical sight. Radar range was sub-
stantiated by the vhf ranging in the command module.
Descent orbit insertion.- The descent orbit insertion maneuver was performed with
the descent engine in the manual throttle configuration. Ignition at the minimum-
throttle setting was smooth, with no noise or sensation of acceleration. After 15 sec-
onds, the thrust level was advanced to 40 percent, as planned. Throttle response was
smooth and free of oscillations. The guided cut-off left residuals of less than 1 ft/sec
in each axis. The X- and Z-axis residuals were reduced to zero by using the reaction
control system. The computer-determined ephemeris was 9.1 by 57.2 miles, as compared
with the predicted value of 8.5 by 57.2 miles. The abort guidance system confirmed that
the magnitude of the maneuver was correct. An additional evaluation was performed by
using the rendezvous radar to check the relative velocity between the two spacecraft at
6 and 7 minutes subsequent to the maneuver. These velocity values corresponded to the
predicted data within 0.5 ft/sec.
Alinement and navigation checks.- Just prior to powered descent, the angle between
the line of sight to the sun and a selected axis of the inertial platform was compared
19

--- PAGE 32 ---
with the onboard computer prediction of that angle, and this comparison provided a check
on inertial platform drift. Three such measurements were all within the specified tol-
erance, but the 0.08° spread between them was somewhat larger than expected.
Visual checks of down-range and cross-range position indicated that ignition for the
powered descent firing would occur at approximately the correct location over the lunar
surface. Based on measurements of the line-of-sight rate of landmarks, the estimates of
altitudes converged on a predicted altitude of 52 000 feet at ignition. These measure-
ments were slightly degraded because of a 10° to 15° yaw bias maintained to improve com-
munications margins.
Powered descent.- Ignition for powered descent occurred on time at the minimum
thrust level, and the engine was automatically advanced to the fixed-throttle point (max-
imum thrust) after 26 seconds. Visual position checks indicated the spacecraft was 2 or
3 seconds early over a known landmark, but with little cross-range error. A yaw maneuver
to a faceup position was initiated at an altitude of about 45 900 feet approximately
4 minutes after ignition. The landing radar began receiving altitude data immediately.
The altitude difference, as displayed from the radar and the computer, was approximately
2800 feet.
At 5 minutes 16 seconds after ignition, the first of a series of computer alarms
indicated a computer overload condition. These alarms continued intermittently for more
than 4 minutes, and although continuation of the trajectory was permissible, monitoring
of the computer information display was occasionally precluded. (See "Computer Alarms
During Descent" in section 16.)
Attitude-thruster firings were heard during each major attitude maneuver and inter-
mittently at other times. Thrust reduction of the descent propulsion system occurred
nearly on time (planned at 6 minutes 24 seconds after ignition) and contributed to the
prediction that the landing would probably be down range of the intended point, inasmuch
as the computer had not been corrected for the observed down-range error.
The transfer to the final-approach-phase program (P64) occurred at the predicted
time. After the pitch maneuver and the radar antenna position change, the control system
transferred from the automatic to the attitude hold mode, and control response checked
was in pitch and roll. Automatic control was restored after the pitch and yaw errors had
been reduced to zero.
After it became clear that an automatic descent would terminate in a boulder field
was extended to avoid the unsatisfactory landing area. The rate-of-descent throttle
surrounding a large sharp-rimmed crater, manual control was again assumed, and the range
control mode (program P66) was entered in the computer to reduce the altitude rate so as
to maintain sufficient height for landing-site surveillance.
Both the down-range and the cross-range positions were adjusted to permit final
descent in a small, relatively level area bounded by a boulder field to the north and
was apparent at 100 feet and became increasingly severe as the altitude decreased. Al-
by sizable craters to the east and south. Surface obscuration caused by blowing dust
though visual determination of horizontal velocity, attitude, and altitude rate were de-
graded, cues for these variables were adequate for landing. Landing conditions are
estimated to have been 1 or 2 ft/sec left, 0 ft/sec forward, and 1 ft/sec down; no evi-
dence of vehicle instability at landing was observed.
Command Module Solo Activities
The Command Module Pilot consolidated all known documentation requirements for a
single volume, known as the Command Module Pilot Solo Book, which was very useful and
20

--- PAGE 33 ---
took the place of a flight plan, a rendezvous book, an updates book, a contingency extra-
vehicular checklist, and so forth. Normally, this book was anchored to the Command Mod-
ule Pilot by a clip attached to the end of his helmet tie-down strap. The sleep period
was timed to coincide with that of the lunar module crew so that radio silence could be
observed. The Command Module Pilot had complete trust in the various systems experts on
duty in the Mission Control Center and therefore was able to sleep soundly.
The method used for target acquisition (program P22) while the lunar module was on
the surface varied considerably from the method used when the spacecraft were docked.
The optical alinement sight reticle was placed on the horizon image, and the resulting
spacecraft attitude was maintained manually at the orbital rate in the minimum-impulse
control mode. Once stabilized, the spacecraft maintained this attitude long enough to
allow the Command Module Pilot to move to the lower equipment bay and take marks. He
could also move from the equipment bay to the hatch window in a few seconds to cross-
check the attitude. In general, this method of operation was satisfactory.
Despite the fact that the Command Module Pilot had several uninterrupted minutes
each time he passed over the lunar module, he could never see the spacecraft on the sur-
face. He was able to scan an area of approximately 1 square mile on each pass, and
ground estimates of lunar module position varied by several miles from pass to pass. It
is doubtful that the Command Module Pilot was ever looking precisely at the lunar module;
he more likely was observing an adjacent area. Although it was not possible to assess
the ability to see the lunar module from 60 miles, it was apparent there were no flashes
of specular light to attract the Command Module Pilot's attention.
The visibility through the sextant was good enough to allow the Command Module Pilot
to acquire the lunar module (in flight) at distances of more than 100 miles. However,
the lunar module was lost in the sextant field of view just prior to powered descent ini-
tiation (120-mile range) and was not regained until after ascent insertion (at an approx-
imate range of 250 miles), when it appeared as a blinking light in the night sky.
In general, more than enough time was available to monitor systems and perform all
necessary functions in a leisurely fashion, except during the rendezvous phase. During
that 3-hour period when hundreds of computer entries, as well as numerous marks and other
manual operations, were required, the Command Module Pilot had little time to devote to
analyzing any off-nominal rendezvous trends as they developed or to cope with any systems
malfunctions. Fortunately, no additional attention to these details was required.
Lunar Surface Operations
Postlanding checkout.- The postlanding checklist was completed as planned. Venting
of the descent oxidizer tanks was begun almost immediately. When the oxidizer tank pres-
sure was vented to between 40 and 50 psi, fuel was vented to the same pressure level.
Apparently, the pressure indications received on the ground were somewhat higher, and
they increased with time. (See "High Fuel Interface Pressure after Landing" in sec-
tion 16.) At ground request, the valves were reopened, and the tanks were vented to
15 psi.
Platform alinement and preparation for early lift-off were completed on schedule
without significant problems. The mission timer malfunctioned and displayed an impossi-
ble number that could not be correlated with any specific failure time. After several
unsuccessful attempts to recycle this timer, it was turned off for 11 hours to cool. The
timer was turned on for ascent, and it operated properly and performed satisfactorily for
the remainder of the mission. (See "Mission Timer Stopped" in section 16.)
Egress preparation.- The crew had given considerable thought to the advantage of
beginning the extravehicular activity as soon as possible after landing instead of
21

--- PAGE 34 ---
following the flight plan schedule and having the surface operations between two rest
periods. The initial rest period was planned to allow flexibility in the event of un-
expected difficulty with postlanding activities. These difficulties did not materialize.
The crewmen were not overly tired, and no problem was experienced in adjusting to the
1/6-g environment. Based on these facts, the decision was made at 104:40:00 to proceed
with the extravehicular activity prior to the first rest period.
Preparation for extravehicular activity began at 106:11:00. The estimate of the
preparation time proved to be optimistic. In simulations, 2 hours had been found to be
a reasonable allocation; however, everything had also been laid out in an orderly manner
in the cockpit, and only those items involved in the extravehicular activity were present.
In actual use, checklists, food packets, monoculars, and other items interfered with an
orderly preparation. All these items required some thought as to their possible inter-
ference or use in the extravehicular activity. This interference resulted in exceeding
the time line estimate by a considerable amount. Preparation for egress was conducted
slowly, carefully, and deliberately, and future missions should be planned and conducted
with the same philosophy. The extravehicular activity preparation checklist was adequate
and was followed closely. However, minor items that required a decision in real time or
that had not been considered before flight required more time than anticipated.
An electrical connector on the cable that connects the remote control unit to the
portable life support system gave some trouble in mating. (See "Mating of Remote Control
Unit to Portable Life Support System" in section 16.) This problem had been encountered
occasionally with the same equipment before flight. At least 10 minutes were required
in order to connect each unit, and at one point it was thought the connection would not
be successfully completed.
Considerable difficulty was experienced with voice communications when the extra-
vehicular transceivers were used inside the lunar module. At times, communications be-
tween the ground and the lunar module were good, but at other times they were garbled
for no obvious reason. Outside the vehicle, no appreciable communications problems OC-
curred. Upon ingress from the surface, communications difficulties recurred, but under
different conditions. That is, the voice dropouts to the ground were not repeatable in
the same manner.
Depressurization of the lunar module was one aspect of the mission that had never
been completely performed on the ground. In the various altitude chamber tests of the
spacecraft and the extravehicular mobility unit, a complete set of authentic conditions
was never present. The depressurization of the lunar module through the bacteria filter
took much longer than had been anticipated. The indicated cabin pressure did not go
below 0.1 psi, and some concern was experienced in opening the forward hatch against this
residual pressure. The hatch appeared to bend on initial opening, and small particles
appeared to be blown out around the hatch when the seal was broken. (See "Slow Cabin
Decompression" in section 16.)
Lunar module egress.- Simulation work in both the water immersion facility and the
1/6-g environment in an airplane was reasonably accurate in preparing the crew for lunar
module egress. Body positioning and arching-the-back techniques were performed in exit-
ing the hatch, and no unexpected problems were experienced. The forward platform was
more than adequate to allow changing the body position from that used in egressing the
hatch to that required for getting on the ladder. The first ladder step was somewhat
difficult to see and required caution and forethought. In general, the hatch, porch,
and ladder operations were not particularly difficult and caused little concern. Oper-
ations on the platform could be performed without losing body balance, and adequate ma-
neuvering room was available.
The initial operation of the lunar equipment conveyor in lowering the camera was
satisfactory, but after the straps had become covered with lunar surface material, a
22

--- PAGE 35 ---
problem arose in transporting the equipment back into the lunar module. Dust from this
equipment fell back onto the lower crewmember and into the cabin and seemed to bind the
conveyor so that considerable force was required in order to operate the conveyor. Al-
ternatives in transporting equipment into the lunar module had been suggested before
flight, and although no opportunity was available to evaluate these techniques, the al-
ternatives might have been an improvement over the conveyor.
Surface exploration.- Work in the 1/6-g environment was a pleasant experience. Ad-
aptation to movement was not difficult, and movement seemed to be natural. Certain spe-
cific peculiarities, such as the effect of the mass as compared to the lack of traction,
can be anticipated; but complete familiarization need not be pursued.
The most effective means of walking seemed to be the lope that evolved naturally.
The fact that both feet were occasionally off the ground at the same time, plus the fact
that the feet did not return to the surface as rapidly as on earth, required some antic-
ipation before an attempt to stop. Noticeable resistance was provided by the suit, al-
though movement was not difficult.
On future flights, crewmembers may want to consider kneeling in order to work with
their hands. Getting to and from the kneeling position would be no problem, and being
able to do more work with the hands would increase productive capability.
Photography with the Hasselblad cameras on the remote control unit mounts produced
no problems. The first panorama was taken while the camera was hand-held; however, the
camera was much easier to operate while on the mount. The handle on the camera was ad-
equate, and few pictures were triggered inadvertently.
The solar wind experiment was easily deployed. As with the other operations involv-
ing lunar surface penetration, it was possible to penetrate the lunar surface material
only approximately 4 or 5 inches. The experiment mount was not quite as stable as de-
sired, but it stayed erect.
The television system presented no difficulty except that the cord was continually
in the way. At first, the white cord showed up well, but it soon became covered with
dust and was therefore more difficult to see. The cable had a "set" from being coiled
around the reel, and it would not lie completely flat on the surface. Even when it was
flat, however, a foot could still slide under it, and the Commander became entangled
several times. (See "Television Cable Retained Coiled Shape" in section 16.)
Collecting the bulk sample required more time than anticipated because the modular-
equipment-stowage-assembly table was in deep shadow, and collecting samples in that area
was far less desirable than taking those in the sunlight. It was also desirable to take
samples as far as possible from the exhaust plume and propellant contamination. An
attempt was made to include a hard rock in each sample, and approximately 20 trips were
required to fill the box. As in simulations, the difficulty of scooping up the material
without throwing it out as the scoop became free created some problem. It was almost
impossible to collect a full scoop of material, and the task required approximately
double the planned time.
Several of the operations would have been easier in sunlight. Although it was pos-
sible to see in the shadows, time had to be allowed for dark adaptation when walking
from the sunlight into the shadow. On future missions, a yaw maneuver just prior to
landing would be advantageous so that the descent stage work area would be in sunlight.
The scientific experiment package was easily deployed manually, and some time was
saved as a result. The package was easy to manage, but finding a level area was diffi-
cult. A good horizon reference was not available, and in the 1/6-g environment, physical
cues were not as effective as in a one-g environment. Therefore, the selection of a
23

--- PAGE 36 ---
deployment site for the experiments caused some problems. The experiments were placed in
an area between shallow craters in surface material which had the same consistency as the
surrounding area and which was expected to be stable. Considerable effort was required
to change the slope of one of the experiments. It was not possible to lower the equip-
ment by merely forcing it down, and it was necessary to move the experiment back and
forth to scrape away the excess surface material.
No abnormal conditions were noted during the lunar module inspection. The insula-
tion on the secondary struts had been damaged from the heat, but the primary struts were
only singed or covered with soot. There was much less damage than on the examples that
had been seen before flight.
Obtaining the core tube sample presented some difficulty. It was impossible to
force the tube more than 4 or 5 inches into the surface material, yet the material pro-
vided insufficient resistance to hold the extension handle in the upright position. Since
the handle had to be held upright, both hands could not be used on the hammer. In addi-
tion, the resistance of the suit made it difficult to steady the core tube and swing the
hammer with any great force. The hammer actually missed several times. The amount of
force used was sufficient to make dents in the handle, but the core tube could be driven
only to a depth of approximately 6 inches. Extraction offered little or virtually no
resistance. Two samples were taken. Insufficient time remained to take the documented
sample, although as wide a variety of rocks as possible was selected in the remaining
time.
The performance of the extravehicular mobility unit was excellent. Neither crewman
felt any thermal discomfort. The Commander used the minimum cooling mode for most of
the surface operation. The Lunar Module Pilot switched to the maximum diverter valve
position immediately after sublimator startup and operated at maximum position for
42 minutes before switching to the intermediate position. The Lunar Module Pilot's
switch remained in the intermediate position for the duration of the extravehicular ac-
tivity. The thermal effect of shadowed areas in comparison to sunlit areas was not de-
tectable inside the suit.
The crewmen were kept physically cool and comfortable, and the ease of performing
in the 1/6-g enviroment indicated that tasks requiring greater physical exertion may be
undertaken on future flights. The Commander experienced some physical exertion while
transporting the sample return container to the lunar module, but his physical limit had
not been approached.
Lunar module ingress.- Ingress to the lunar module produced no problems. The capa-
bility to do a vertical jump was used to an advantage in making the first step up the
ladder. By doing a deep knee bend, then springing up the ladder, the Commander was able
to guide his feet to the third step. Movements in the 1/6-g environment were slow enough
to allow deliberate foot placement after the jump. The ladder was somewhat slippery from
the powdery surface material, but not dangerously SO.
As previously stated, mobility on the platform was adequate for developing alternate
methods of transferring equipment from the surface. The hatch opened easily, and the
ingress technique developed before flight was satisfactory. At a point about halfway
through the hatch, a concerted effort to arch the back was required in order to keep the
forward end of the portable life support system low enough to clear the hatch. Little
exertion was associated with transition to a standing position.
Because of the bulk of the extravehicular mobility unit, caution had to be exercised
to avoid bumping into switches, circuit breakers, and other controls while moving around
the cockpit. One circuit breaker was in fact broken as a result of contact (section 16).
24

--- PAGE 37 ---
Equipment jettison was performed as planned, and the time taken before flight in
determining the items not required for lift-off was well spent. Considerable weight re-
duction and increase in space was realized. Discarding the equipment through the hatch
was not difficult, and only one item remained on the platform. The post-ingress checklist
procedures were performed without difficulty; the checklist was well-planned and was fol-
Towed precisely.
Lunar rest period.- The rest period was almost completely unsatisfactory. The hel-
mets and gloves were worn to relieve subconscious anxiety about a loss of cabin pressure,
and they presented no problem. But noise, lighting, and a lower-than-desired temperature
were annoying. The suits were uncomfortably cool, even with the waterflow disconnected.
Oxygen flow was finally cut off, and the helmets were removed, but the noise from the
glycol pumps was then loud enough to interrupt sleep. The window shades did not com-
pletely block out light, and the cabin was illuminated by a combination of light passing
through the shades, warning lights, and display lighting. The Commander rested on the
ascent engine cover and was bothered by the light entering through the telescope. The
Lunar Module Pilot estimated that he slept fitfully for perhaps 2 hours, and the Commander
did not sleep at all, even though body positioning was not a problem. Because of the re-
duced gravity, the positions on the floor and on the engine cover were both quite
comfortable.
Launch Preparation
Alining the platform before lift-off was complicated by the limited number of stars
available. Because of sun and earth interference, only two detents effectively remained
from which to select stars. Accuracy is greater for stars close to the center of the
field, but none were available at this location. A gravity/one-star alinement was suc-
cessfully performed. A manual averaging technique was used to sample five successive
cursor readings and then five spiral readings. The result was then entered into the com-
puter. This technique appeared to be easier than taking and then entering five separate
readings. Torquing angles were close to 0.7° in all three axes and indicated that the
2
platform drifted.
After the alinement, the navigation program was entered. It is recommended that
future crews update the abort guidance system with the primary guidance state vector at
this point and then use the abort guidance system to determine the command module loca-
tion. The primary guidance system cannot be used to determine the command module range
and range rate, and the radar will not lock on until the command module is within a
400-mile range. As this range is approached, the abort guidance system provides valid
data.
A cold-fire reaction control system check and an abort guidance system calibration
were performed, and the ascent pad was taken. Approximately 45 minutes prior to lift-
off, another platform alinement was performed. The landing-site alinement option at
ignition was used for lift-off. The torquing angles for this alinement were approxi-
mately 0.09°.
In accordance with ground instructions, the rendezvous radar was placed in the an-
tenna SLEW position with the circuit breakers off for ascent to avoid recurrence of the
alarms experienced during a descent.
Both crewmembers had forgotten to watch for the small helium pressure decrease in-
dication that the Apollo 10 crew experienced when the ascent tanks were pressurized, and
2 Editor's note: However, platform drift was within specification limits.
25

--- PAGE 38 ---
the crew initially believed that only one tank had been pressurized. This oversight was
temporary, but it delayed the crew verification of proper pressurization of both tanks.
Ascent
The pyrotechnic noises at descent stage separation were loud, but ascent-engine
ignition was inaudible. The yaw and pitch maneuvers were smooth. The pitch- and roll-
attitude limit cycles were as expected and were not accompanied by physiological diffi-
culities. Both the primary and the abort guidance systems indicated the ascent to be a
duplicate of the planned trajectory. The guided cut-off yielded residuals of less than
2 ft/sec; and the inplane components were nulled to within 0.1 ft/sec with the reaction
control system. Throughout the trajectory, the ground track could be visually verified,
although a pitch attitude confirmation by use of the horizon in the overhead window was
difficult because of the horizon lighting condition.
Rendezvous
At orbital insertion, the primary guidance system showed an orbit of 47.3 by
9.5 miles, as compared to the abort guidance system solution of 46.6 by 9.5 miles.
Since radar range-rate data were not available, the Manned Space Flight Network quickly
confirmed that the orbital insertion was satisfactory.
In the preflight planning, stars had been chosen that would be in the field of view
and that would require a minimum amount of maneuvering to get through alinement and back
in plane. This maintenance of a nearly fixed attitude would permit the radar to be
turned on and the acquisition conditions to be designated so that marks for a coelliptic
sequence initiation solution would be immediately available. During the simulations,
these preselected stars had not been correctly located relative to the horizon, and time
and fuel were wasted in first maneuvering to these stars, then failing to mark on them,
and finally maneuvering to an alternate pair. Even with these problems, the alinement
was finished approximately 28 minutes before the coelliptic sequence initiation, and it
was possible to proceed with radar lock-on.
All four sources for the coelliptic sequence initiation solution agreed to within
0.2 ft/sec, an accuracy that had never been observed before. The Commander elected to
use the primary guidance solution without any out-of-plane thrusting.
The coelliptic sequence initiation maneuver was accomplished by using the plus Z
thrusters, and the radar lock-on was maintained throughout the firing. Continued navi-
gation tracking by both spacecraft indicated a plane-change maneuver of approximately
2.5 ft/sec, but the crew elected to defer this small correction until terminal phase
initiation. The small out-of-plane velocities that existed between the spacecraft orbits
indicated a highly accurate lunar surface alinement. As a result of the higher-than-
expected ellipticity of the command module orbit, backup chart solutions were not possi-
ble for the first two rendezvous maneuvers, and the constant-differential height maneuver
had a higher-than-expected vertical component. The computers in both spacecraft agreed
closely on the maneuver values, and the lunar module primary guidance computer solution
was executed by using the minus X thrusters.
During the coelliptic phase, radar tracking data were inserted into the abort guid-
ance system to obtain an independent intercept guidance solution. The primary guidance
solution was 6-1/2 minutes later than planned. However, the intercept trajectory was
nominal, with only two small midcourse corrections of 1.0 and 1.5 ft/sec. The line-of-
sight rates were low, and the planned braking schedule was used to reach a station-
keeping position.
26

--- PAGE 39 ---
In the process of maneuvering the lunar module to the docking attitude, while at the
same time avoiding direct sunlight in the forward windows, the platform inadvertently
reached gimbal lock. The docking was completed by using the abort guidance system for
attitude control.
Command Module Docking
Predocking activities in the command module were normal in all respects, as was
docking up to the point of probe capture. After the Command Module Pilot ascertained
that a successful capture had occurred, as indicated by "barberpole" indicators, the
CMC-FREE switch position was used and one retract bottle fired. A right yaw excursion
of approximately 15° took place immediately for 1 or 2 seconds. The Command Module Pilot
went back to the CMC-AUTO switch position and made hand-controller inputs to reduce the
angle between the two vehicles to zero. At docking, thruster firings occurred unexpect-
edly in the lunar module when the retract mechanism was actuated, and attitude excursions
of up to 15° were observed. The lunar module was manually realined. While this maneuver
was in progress, all 12 docking latches fired, and docking was completed successfully.
(See "Guidance, Navigation, and Control" in section 8.)
Following docking, the tunnel was cleared, and the probe and drogue were stowed in
the lunar module. The items to be transferred to the command module were cleaned by
using a vacuum brush attached to the lunar module suit return hose. The suction was low,
and as a result, the process was rather tedious. The sample return containers and film
magazines were placed in appropriate bags to complete the transfer, and the lunar module
was configured for jettison according to the checklist procedure.
Transearth Injection
The time between docking and transearth injection was more than adequate to clean
all equipment contaminated with lunar surface material and to return it to the command
module for stowage SO that the necessary preparations for transearth injection could be
made. The transearth injection maneuver, the last service propulsion engine firing of
the flight, was nominal. The only difference between the transearth maneuver and pre-
vious firings was that without the docked lunar module, the start transient was apparent.
Transearth Coast
During transearth coast, faint spots or scintillations of light were observed within
the command module cabin. These phenomena became apparent after the Commander and the
Lunar Module Pilot became dark-adapted and relaxed.
3
3 Editor's note: The source or cause of the light scintillations is as yet unknown.
One explanation involves primary cosmic rays with energies in the range of billions of
electron volts bombarding an object in outer space. The theory assumes that numerous
heavy and high-energy cosmic particles penetrate the command module structure, causing
heavy ionization inside the spacecraft. When liberated electrons recombine with ions,
photons in the visible portion of the spectrum are emitted. If a sufficient number of
photons is emitted, a dark-adapted observer can detect the photons as a small spot or a
streak of light. Two simple laboratory experiments were conducted to substantiate the
theory, but no positive results were obtained in a 5-psi pressure environment because a
high enough energy source was not available to create the radiation at that pressure.
This level of radiation does not present a crew hazard.
27

--- PAGE 40 ---
Only one midcourse correction, a reaction control system firing of 4.8 ft/sec, was
required during transearth coast. In general, the transearth coast period was character- to
sample the excellent variety of food packets and to take photographs of the shrinking
ized by a general relaxation on the part of the crew, with plenty of time available

5. LUNAR DESCENT AND ASCENT
Descent Trajectory Logic
The lunar descent trajectory, shown in figure 5-1, began with a descent orbit inser-
tion maneuver targeted to place the spacecraft into a 60- by 8.2-mile orbit with the
pericynthion longitude located approximately 260 miles up range from the landing site.
Powered descent, shown in figure 5-2, was initiated at pericynthion and continued through
landing.
The powered descent trajectory was designed with factors considered such as optimum
propellant usage, navigation uncertainties, landing-radar performance, terrain uncer-
tainties, and crew visibility restrictions. The basic premise during trajectory design
was to maintain near-optimum use of propellant during initial braking and to provide a
standard final approach from which the landing area could be assessed and a desirable
landing location selected. The onboard guidance capability allowed the crew to redesig-
nate the desired landing position in the computer for automatic execution or, if late in
the trajectory, to take over manually and fly the lunar module to the desired point. To
provide these descent characteristics, compatibility between the automatic and manually
controlled trajectories was required, as well as acceptable flying quality under manual
control. Because of guidance dispersions, site-selection uncertainties, visibility
restrictions, and undefined surface irregularities, measures were taken to provide the
crew adequate flexibility in the terminal-approach technique, with the principal limita-
tion being descent propellant quantity.
The major phases of powered descent are the braking phase (which terminates at an
altitude of 7700 feet), the approach or visibility phase (to an altitude of approximately
500 feet), and the final landing phase. Three separate computer programs, one for each
phase, in the primary guidance system execute the desired trajectory such that the vari-
ous position, velocity, acceleration, and visibility constraints are satisfied. These
programs provide an automatic guidance and control capability for the lunar module from
powered descent initiation to landing. The braking phase program (P63) is initiated
approximately 40 minutes before the descent engine ignition and controls the lunar module
until the final approach phase program (P64) is automatically entered to provide proper
trajectory conditions and optimum landing-site visibility.
If desired, during a nominal descent, the crew may select the manual landing phase
program (P66) prior to completion of the final approach phase program (P64). If the
manual landing phase program (P66) is not entered, the automatic landing phase program
(P65) will be entered automatically when the time to go equals 12 seconds (at an altitude
of approximately 150 feet). The automatic landing phase program (P65) initiates an
automatic descent by nulling the horizontal velocity relative to the surface and main-
taining the rate of descent at 3 ft/sec. The manual landing phase program (P66) is
initiated when the crew changes the position of the primary guidance mode control switch
from automatic to attitude-hold and then actuates the rate-of-descent control switch.
Spacecraft attitude changes are then controlled manually by the crew; the descent engine
throttle is under computer control; and the Commander can introduce 1-ft/sec increments
into the descent rate by using the rate-of-descent switch.
To assure proper operation of the onboard systems throughout the descent phase,
maximum use was made (both on board and on the ground) of all data, system responses,
and cues, based on the spacecraft position with respect to the designated lunar features.
The two onboard guidance systems provided the crew with a continuous check of selected
navigation parameters. Comparisons were made on the ground between data from each of
the onboard systems and comparable information derived from tracking data. A powered
flight processor was used to simultaneously reduce Doppler tracking data from three or
29

--- PAGE 42 ---
more ground stations and to calculate the required parameters. A filtering technique
was used to compute corrections to the Doppler tracking data and thereby define an accu-
rate vehicle state vector. The ground data were used as a voting source in case of a
slow divergence between the two onboard systems.

Preparation for Powered Descent
Following the first sleep period in lunar orbit, the crew entered and began activa-
tion of the lunar module. (See "Descent Preparation" in section 4.) A listing of the
significant events for lunar module descent is presented in table 5-I.
Undocking was accomplished on schedule just prior to acquisition of signal on lunar
revolution 13. After the lunar module inspection by the Command Module Pilot, a separa-
tion maneuver was performed by the command and service modules; 20 minutes later, the
rendezvous-radar and vhf ranging outputs were compared. The two systems agreed and indi-
cated a 0.7-mile range. The inertial measurement unit was alined optically for the first
time, and the resulting gyro torquing angles were well within the platform drift criteria
for a satisfactory primary system. Descent orbit insertion was performed on time approx-
imately 8 minutes after Manned Space Flight Network loss of signal. Table 5-II
contains the trajectory information on the descent orbit insertion, as reported by the
crew following acquisition of signal on lunar revolution 14. An incorrectly loaded tar-
get vector caused a relatively large Z-axis residual for the abort guidance system. With
this exception, the residuals were well within the three-sigma dispersion (+0.6 ft/sec)
predicted before flight.
Following descent orbit insertion, rendezvous-radar data were recorded by the Lunar
Module Pilot and were used to predict that the pericynthion point would be at an altitude
of approximately 50 000 feet. Initial checks using the landing point designator capa-
bility produced close agreement by indicating an altitude of 52 000 feet. Following
descent orbit insertion, the crew also reported that a solar sighting performed by using
the alinement telescope was well within the powered descent initiation go/no-go criterion
of 0.25°. The solar sighting consisted of acquiring the sun through the telescope and
comparing the actual gimbal angles to those theoretically required and computed by the
onboard computer for this observation. This check is an even more accurate indication
of platform performance if the 0.07° bias correction for the telescope rear detent posi-
tion is subtracted from the recorded data.
The comparison of velocity residuals between ground tracking data and the onboard
system, as calculated along the earth-moon line-of-sight, provided an additional check
on the performance of the primary guidance system. A 2-ft/sec residual was recorded at
acquisition of signal and provided confidence that the onboard state vector would have
altitude and down-range velocity errors of small magnitude at powered descent initia-
tion. The Doppler residual was computed by comparing the velocity measured along the
earth-moon line-of-sight by ground tracking with the same velocity component computed by
the primary system. As the lunar module approached powered descent initiation, the
Doppler residual began to increase in magnitude to approximately 13 ft/sec. Because the
earth-moon line-of-sight vector was almost normal to the velocity vector at this point,
the residual indicated that the primary system estimate of its state vector was approxi-
mately 21 000 feet up range of the actual state vector. This same error was also re-
flected in the real-time comparisons made by using the powered flight processor previously
mentioned. Table 5-III is a comparison of the latitude, longitude, and altitude between
the best-estimate trajectory state vector at powered descent initiation, the operational
32

--- PAGE 45 ---
trajectory, and the preflight calculated trajectory. The onboard state-vector errors at
powered descent initiation resulted from a combination of the following conditions:
1. Uncoupled thruster firings during the docked landmark tracking exercise
2. Unaccounted-for velocity accrued during undocking and subsequent inspection and
station-keeping activity
3. Descent orbit insertion residual
4. Propagated errors in the lunar potential function
5. Lunar module venting

Powered Descent
The powered descent maneuver began with a 26-second thrusting period at minimum
throttle. Immediately after ignition, S-band communications were interrupted momentarily
but were reestablished when the antenna was switched from the automatic to the slew posi-
tion. The descent maneuver was initiated in a facedown attitude to permit the crew to
make time marks on selected landmarks. A landing point designator sighting on the crater
Maskelyne W was approximately 3 seconds early, confirming the suspected down-range error.
Following the landmark sightings, a yaw maneuver to faceup attitude was initiated at an
indicated altitude of approximately 45 900 feet. The maneuver took longer than expected
because of an incorrect setting of a rate display switch.
Landing-radar lock-on occurred before the end of the yaw maneuver, with the space-
craft rotating at approximately 4 deg/sec. The altitude difference between that calcu-
lated by the onboard computer and that determined by the landing radar was approximately
2800 feet, which agreed with the altitude error suspected from the Doppler residual com-
parison. Radar altitude updates of the onboard computer were enabled at 102:38:45, and
the differences converged within 30 seconds. Velocity updates began automatically
4 seconds after the altitude update was enabled. Two altitude-difference transients
occurred during computer alarms and were apparently associated with incomplete radar data
readout operations. (See "Computer Alarms During Descent" in section 16.)
The reduction in throttle setting was predicted to occur 384 seconds after ignition;
actual throttle reduction occurred at 386 seconds, which indicated nominal performance
of the descent engine.
34

--- PAGE 47 ---
The first of five computer alarms occurred approximately 5 minutes after initiation
of the descent. Occurrences of these alarms are indicated in table 5-1 and are discussed
in "Computer Alarms During Descent" in section 16. Although the alarms did not degrade
the performance of any primary guidance or control function, they did interfere with an
early assessment of the landing approach by the crew.
Arrival at high gate (end of braking phase) and the automatic switch to the final
approach phase program (P64) occurred at 7129 feet at a 125-ft/sec descent rate. These
values are slightly lower than predicted but are within acceptable boundaries. At
approximately 5000 feet, the Commander switched his control mode from automatic to
attitude-hold to check manual control in anticipation of the final descent.
After the pitchover at high gate, the landing point designator indicated that the
approach path was leading into a large crater. An unplanned redesignation was introduced
at this time. To avoid the crater, the Commander again switched from automatic to
attitude-hold control and manually increased the flight-path angle by pitching to a
nearly vertical attitude for range extension. Manual control began at an altitude of
approximately 600 feet. Ten seconds later, at approximately 400 feet, the rate-of-
descent mode was activated to control descent velocity. In this manner, the spacecraft
was guided approximately 1100 feet down range from the initial aim point.
Figure 5-3 contains histories of altitude compared with altitude rate from the pri-
mary and abort guidance systems and from the Manned Space Flight Network powered flight
processor. The altitude difference existing between the primary system and the Manned
Space Flight Network at powered descent initiation can be observed in figure 5-3. All
three sources are initialized to the primary guidance state vector at powered descent
initiation. However, the primary system is updated by the landing radar, and the abort
guidance system is not. As indicated in figure 5-3, the altitude read-outs from both
systems gradually diverged so as to indicate a lower altitude for the primary system
until the abort system was manually updated with altitude data from the primary system.
The powered flight processor data reflect both the altitude and down-range errors
existing in the primary system at powered descent initiation. The radial velocity error
is directly proportional to the down-range position error such that a 1000-foot down-
range error will cause a 1-ft/sec radial velocity error. Therefore, the 20 000-foot
down-range error existing at powered descent initiation was also reflected as a 20-ft/sec
radial velocity residual. In figure 5-3, this error is apparent in the altitude region
near 27 000 feet, where an error of approximately 20 ft/sec is evident. The primary-
system altitude error in existence at powered descent initiation manifests itself at
touchdown when the powered flight processor indicates a landing altitude below the lunar
surface. Figure 5-4 contains a similar comparison of lateral velocity from the three
sources. Again, the divergence noted in the final phases in the abort guidance system
data was caused by a lack of radar updates.
Figure 5-5 contains a time history of spacecraft pitch attitude recorded by the
primary and abort guidance systems. The scale is set up SO that a pitch of 0° would
place the X-axis of the spacecraft vertical at the landing site. Two separate designa-
tions of the landing site are evident in the phase after manual takeover. Figure 5-6
contains comparisons for the pitch and roll attitudes and indicates the lateral correc-
tions made in the final phase.
Figure 5-7 is an enlarged photograph of the area adjacent to the lunar landing site
and shows the final portions of the ground track to landing. Figure 5-8 is an area
photograph, taken from a Lunar Orbiter flight, showing the landing-site ellipse and
the ground track flown to the landing point. Figure 5-9 contains a preliminary attempt to
reconstruct the surface terrain viewed during descent, based upon trajectory and radar
data and upon known surface features. The coordinates of the landing point, as obtained
35

--- PAGE 48 ---
from the various real-time and postflight sources, are shown in table 5-IV. As shown in
figure 5-10, the actual landing point was latitude 0°41'15" N and longitude 23°26' E,
compared with the targeted landing point of latitude 0°43'53" N and longitude 23°38'51" E.
In this report, figure 5-10 is the basic reference map for the location of the landing
point. As noted, the landing point dispersion was caused primarily by errors in the on-
board state vector prior to powered descent initiation.
Figure 5-11 is a time history of pertinent vehicle control parameters during the
entire descent phase. Evidence of fuel slosh was detected in the attitude-rate informa-
tion following the yaw maneuver. The slosh effect increased to the point where reaction
control thruster firings were required to damp the rate prior to throttle recovery. The
dynamic behavior at this point and through the remainder of the descent was comparable
to that observed in simulations and indicates nominal control system performance.
Approximately 95 pounds of reaction control propellant were used during powered
descent, as compared to the predicted value of 40 pounds. Plots of propellant consump-
tion for the reaction control and descent propulsion systems are shown in figure 5-12.
The reaction control propellant consumption while in the manual descent control mode was
51 pounds, approximately 1-1/2 times greater than that for the automatic mode. This in-
crease in usage rate is attributed to the requirement for greater attitude and transla-
tion maneuvering in the final stages of descent. The descent propulsion system
propellant usage was greater than predicted because of the additional time required for
the landing-site redesignation.

Following the Apollo 10 mission, a difference was noted (from the landmark track-
ing results) between the trajectory coordinate system and the coordinate system on the
reference map. In order to reference trajectory values to the 1:100,000 scale Lunar
Map ORB-II-6 (100), dated December 1967, correction factors of +2'25" in latitude and
-4'17" in longitude must be applied to the trajectory values.
bAll latitude values are corrected for the estimated out-of-plane position error
at powered descent initiation.
CThese coordinate values are referenced to Lunar Map ORB-II-6 (100) and include
the correction factors.

Landing Dynamics
The landing on the lunar surface occurred at 102:45:39.9 with negligible forward
velocity, approximately 2.1 ft/sec to the crew's left and 1.7 ft/sec vertically. Fig-
ure 5-13 shows the body-rate transients which indicate that the right and the forward
landing gear touched almost simultaneously, giving the spacecraft a roll-left and a
pitch-up motion. The left-directed lateral velocity resulted in a slight yaw-right tran-
sient at the point of touchdown. These touchdown conditions, obtained from attitude
rates and integration of accelerometer data, were verified qualitatively by the at-rest
positions of the lunar surface sensing probes and by surface buildup around the rims of
the footpads. Figure 11-17 (in section 11) shows the probe boom nearly vertical on the
inboard side of the minus Y footpad, indicating a velocity component in the minus Y di-
rection. Built-up lunar material can be seen outboard of the pad, which also indicates
a lateral velocity in this direction. The probe position and lunar material disturbance
produced by the minus Z gear assembly (fig. 11-17) indicate a lateral velocity in the
minus Y direction. Figure 11-16 (in section 11) shows in greater detail the surface
material disturbance on the minus Y side of the minus Z footpad. The plus Y landing gear
assembly supports the conclusion of a minus Y velocity because the probe was on the out-
board side and material was piled in board of the pad.

The crew reported no sensation of rockup (postcontact instability) during the touch-
down phase. A postflight simulation of the landing dynamics indicates that the maximum
rockup angle was only approximately 2°, which is indicative of a stable landing. In the
simulation, the maximum footpad penetration was 2.5 to 3.5 inches, with an associated
vehicle slideout (skidding) of 1 to 3 inches. The landing gear struts stroked less than
1 inch, which represents about 10 percent of the energy absorption capability of the low-
level primary-strut honeycomb cartridge. Examination of photographs indicates agreement
with this analytical conclusion.
Postlanding Spacecraft Operations
Immediately after landing, the lunar module crew began a simulated launch countdown
in preparation for the possibility of a contingency lift-off. Two problems arose during
this simulated countdown. First, the mission timer had stopped and could not be re-
started; therefore, the event timer was started by using a mark from the ground. Second,
the descent stage fuel-helium heat exchanger froze, apparently with fuel trapped between
the heat exchanger and the valves, causing the pressure in the line to increase. (See
"Mission Timer Stopped" and "High Fuel Interface Pressure After Landing" in section 16
for further discussion of these problems.)
The inertial measurement unit was alined three times during this period by using
each of the three available lunar surface alinement options. The alinements were satis-
factory, and the results provided confidence in the technique. The simulated countdown
was terminated at 104-1/2 hours, and a partial power-down of the lunar module was
initiated.
During the lunar surface stay, the Command Module Pilot made several unsuccessful
attempts to locate the lunar module through the sextant by using sighting coordinates
transmitted from the ground. Estimates of the landing coordinates were obtained from
the lunar module computer, the lunar surface gravity alinement of the platform, and the
limited interpretation of the geological features during descent. Figure 5-14 shows the
areas that were tracked and the times of closest approach that were used for the sight-
ings. The actual landing site, as determined from films taken during the descent, did
not lie near the center of the sextant field of view for any of the coordinates used;
therefore, the ability to acquire the lunar module from a 60-mile orbit can neither be
established nor denied. The Command Module Pilot reported that only one grid square
could be scanned during a single pass.
Because of the unsuccessful attempts to sight the lunar module from the command
module, the decision was made to track the command module from the lunar module by using
the rendezvous radar. The command module was acquired at a 79.9-mile range and a
3236-ft/sec closing rate, and loss of track occurred at 85.3 miles with a receding range-
rate of 3531 ft/sec (fig. 5-15).
The inertial measurement unit was successfully alined two more times prior to lift-
off, once to obtain a drift check and once to establish the proper inertial orientation
for lift-off. The drift check indicated normal system operation, as discussed in "Guid-
ance and Control" in section 9. An abort guidance system alinement was also performed
prior to lift-off; however, a procedural error caused an azimuth misalinement, which
resulted in the out-of-plane velocity error discussed in "Guidance and Control" in
section 9.

Ascent
Preparations for ascent began after the end of the crew rest period at 121 hours.
The command module state vector was updated from the ground, with coordinates provided
for crater 130, a planned landmark. This crater was tracked by using the command module
sextant on the revolution prior to lift-off to establish the target orbit plane. During
this revolution, the rendezvous radar was used to track the command module, as previously
mentioned, and the lunar surface navigation program (P22) was exercised to establish the
location of the lunar module relative to the orbit plane. Crew activities during the
preparation for launch were conducted as planned, and lift-off occurred on time.
The ascent phase was initiated by a 10-second period of vertical rise, which allowed
the ascent stage to clear the descent stage and surrounding terrain obstacles safely and
provided for rotation of the spacecraft to the correct launch azimuth. The pitch-over
maneuver to a 50° attitude with respect to the local vertical began-when the ascent
velocity reached 40 ft/sec. Powered ascent was targeted to place the spacecraft in a
10- by 45-mile orbit to establish the correct initial conditions for the rendezvous.
Figure 5-16 shows the planned ascent trajectory, as compared with the actual ascent
trajectory.
The crew reported that the ascent was smooth, with normal reaction control thruster
activity. The ascent stage appeared to "wallow" or traverse the attitude deadbands, as
expected. Figure 5-17 contains a time history of selected control system parameters
during the ascent maneuver. A data dropout occurred immediately after lift-off and made
accurate determination of the fire-in-the-hole forces difficult. The body rates recorded
just prior to the data dropout were small (less than 5 deg/sec) but were increasing in
magnitude at the time of the dropout. However, crew reports and associated dynamic
information during the data-loss period do not indicate that any rates exceeded the ex-
pected ranges.
The predominant disturbance torque during ascent was about the pitch axis and
appears to have been caused by thrust vector offset. Figure 5-18 contains an expanded
view of control system parameters during a selected period of the ascent phase. The
digital autopilot was designed to control about axes offset approximately 45° from the
spacecraft body axes and normally to fire only plus X thrusters during powered ascent.
Therefore, down-firing thrusters 2 and 3 were used almost exclusively during the early
phases of the ascent and were fired alternately to control the pitch disturbance torque.
These jets induced a roll rate while counteracting the pitch disturbance; therefore, the
accompanying roll motion contributed to the wallowing sensation reported by the crew.
As the maneuver progressed, the center of gravity moved toward the thrust vector, and
the resulting pitch disturbance torque and required thruster activity decreased until
almost no disturbance was present. Near the end of the maneuver, the center of gravity
moved to the opposite side of the thrust vector, and proper thruster activity to correct
for this opposite disturbance torque can be observed in figure 5-17.
The crew reported that the velocity-to-be-gained indication in the abort guidance
system differed 50 to 100 ft/sec from the primary-system indication near the end of the
ascent maneuver. The reason for these differences appears to be unsynchronized data dis-
played from the two systems (section 9).
Table 5-V contains a comparison of insertion conditions between those calculated by
various onboard sources and the planned values. Satisfactory agreement is indicated by
all sources. The powered flight processor was again used and indicated performance well
within the ranges expected for both systems.

Figure 5-18.- Expanded time history of spacecraft
rates during ascent.
Rendezvous
Immediately after ascent insertion, the Commander began a platform alinement by
using the lunar module telescope. During this time, the ground relayed the lunar module
state vector to the command module computer to permit execution of navigation updates by
using the sextant and the vhf ranging system. The lunar module platform alinement took
longer than expected; consequently, the coelliptic sequence initiation program was entered
into the computer approximately 7 minutes later than planned. This delay allowed less
than the nominal 18 radar navigation updates between insertion and the first rendezvous
maneuver. Also, the first range-rate measurement for the backup solution was missed; how-
ever, this loss was not significant because both the lunar module and the command module
guidance systems performed normally. Figure 5-19 shows the ascent and rendezvous trajec-
tories and their relationship in lunar orbit.
Prior to the coelliptic sequence initiation, the lunar module out-of-plane velocity
was computed by the command module to be -1.0 ft/sec, a value small enough to be deferred
until terminal phase initiation. The final lunar module solution for coelliptic sequence
initiation was a 51.5-ft/sec maneuver to be performed with the Z-axis reaction control
thrusters, with a planned ignition time of 125:19:34.7.
Following the coelliptic sequence initiation maneuver, the constant differential
height program was called up in both spacecraft. Operation of the guidance systems con-
tinued to be normal, and successful navigation updates were obtained by using the sex-
tant, the vhf ranging system, and the rendezvous radar. The Lunar Module Pilot reported
that the backup range-rate measurement at 36 minutes prior to the constant differential
height maneuver was outside the limits of the backup chart. Postflight trajectory analy-
sis has shown that the off-nominal command module orbit (62 by 56 miles) caused the range-
rate measurement to be approximately 60 ft/sec below nominal at the 36-minute data point.
The command module was near pericynthion and the lunar module was near apocynthion at the
measurement point. These conditions, which decreased the lunar module closure rate to
below the nominal value, are apparent in figure 5-20, a relative motion plot of the two
spacecraft between insertion and the constant differential height maneuver. Figure 5-20
was obtained by forward and backward integration of the last available lunar module state
vector prior to loss of signal following insertion and the final constant differential
height maneuver vector integrated backward to the coelliptic sequence initiation point.
60

--- PAGE 73 ---
The dynamic range of the backup charts has been increased for future landing missions.
The constant differential height maneuver was accomplished at the lunar module primary
guidance computer time of 126:17:49.6.
The constant differential height maneuver was performed with a total velocity change
of 19.9 ft/sec. In a nominal coelliptic flight plan with a circular target orbit for the
command module, the velocity change for this maneuver would be zero. However, the ellip-
ticity of the command module orbit required a real-time change in the rendezvous plan
prior to lift-off to include approximately 5 ft/sec (applied retrograde) to compensate
for the change in differential height upon arriving at this maneuver point and approxi-
mately 11 ft/sec (applied vertically) to rotate the line of apsides to the correct angle.
Actual execution errors in ascent insertion and coelliptic sequence initiation resulted
in an additional velocity change requirement of approximately 8 ft/sec, which yielded the
actual total of 19.9 ft/sec.
Following the constant differential height maneuver, the computers in both space-
craft were configured for terminal phase initiation. Navigation updates were made, and
several computer recycles were performed to obtain an early indication of the maneuver
time. The final computation was initiated 12 minutes prior to the maneuver, as planned.
planned. Ignition had been computed to occur at 127:03:39, or 6 minutes 39 seconds later than
Soon after the terminal phase initiation maneuver, both spacecraft passed behind
the moon. At the next acquisition, the spacecraft were flying in formation in prepara-
tion for docking. The crew reported that the rendezvous was nominal, with the velocity
change for the first midcourse maneuver less than 1 ft/sec and for the second approxi-
mately 1.5 ft/sec. The midcourse maneuvers were performed by thrusting the body-axis
components to zero, while the lunar module plus Z axis remained pointed at the command
module. The line-of-sight rates were reported to be small, and the planned braking was
used for the approach to station keeping. The lunar module and command module maneuver
solutions are summarized in tables 5-VI and 5-VII, respectively.
During the docking maneuver, two unexpected events occurred. In the alinement pro-
cedure for docking, the lunar module was maneuvered through the platform gimbal-lock
attitude, and the docking had to be completed by using the abort guidance system for
attitude control. The off-nominal attitude resulted from an added rotation to avoid
sunlight interference in the forward windows. The sun elevation was approximately 20°
higher than planned because the angle for initiation of the terminal phase was reached
approximately 6 minutes late.
The second unexpected event occurred after docking and consisted of relative vehicle
alinement excursions of as much as 15° following initiation of the retract sequence. The
proper docking sequence consists of (1) initial contact, (2) lunar module plus X thrust-
ing from initial contact to capture latch, (3) switching of the command module control
from the automatic to the manual mode, (4) relative motions to be damped to within +3°,
and (5) initiation of retract to achieve hard docking. The Commander detected the rela-
tively low velocity at initial contact and applied plus X thrusting; however, the thrust-
ing was continued until after the misalinement excursion had developed because the
Commander had received no indication of the capture event. The dynamics were complicated
further when the Command Module Pilot also noticed the excursions and reversed the com-
mand module control mode from manual to automatic. At this time, both the lunar module
and the command module were in the minimum-deadband attitude-hold mode, thereby causing
considerable thruster firing until the lunar module was placed in maximum deadband. The
spacecraft were stabilized by using manual control just prior to achieving a successful
hard dock. The initial observed misalinement excursion is considered to have been caused
by the continued lunar module thrusting following capture because the thrust vector does
not pass through the center of gravity of the command and service modules.

The rendezvous was successful and was similar to that for Apollo 10, with all guid-
ance and control systems operating satisfactorily. The Command Module Pilot reported
that the vhf ranging broke lock approximately 25 times following ascent insertion; how-
ever, lock-on was reestablished each time, and navigation updates were successful. The
lunar module reaction control propellant usage was nearly nominal.

6. COMMUNICATIONS
Performance of all communications systems (sections 8, 9, 10, and 13) - including
those of the command module, lunar module, portable life support system, and Manned
Space Flight Network - - was generally as expected. This section presents only those
aspects of communications systems performance which were unique to the Apollo 11 flight.
The performance of these systems was otherwise consistent with that of previous flights.
The S-band communications system provided good-quality voice, as did the vhf link within
its range capability. The performance of command module and lunar module up-data links
was nominal, and real-time and playback telemetry performance was excellent. Color
television pictures of high quality were received from the command module. Good-quality
black-and-white television pictures were received and converted to standard format during
lunar surface operations. Excellent-quality tracking data were obtained for both the
command and the lunar modules. The received up-link and down-link signal powers corre-
sponded to preflight predictions. Communications systems management, including antenna
switching, was generally good.
Two-way phase lock with the command module S-band equipment was maintained by the
Merritt Island, Grand Bahama Island, Bermuda, and U.S.N.S. Vanguard stations through
orbital insertion, except during S-IC/S-II staging, interstage jettison, and station-to-
station handovers. A complete loss of up-link lock and command capability was encountered
between 6 and 6-1/2 minutes after earth lift-off because the operator of the ground
transmitter at the Grand Bahama Island station terminated transmission 30 seconds early.
Full S-band communications capability was restored at the scheduled handover time when
the Bermuda station established two-way phase lock. During the Merritt Island station
coverage of the launch phase, PM and FM receivers were used to demodulate the received
telemetry data. (Normally, only the PM data link is used.) The purpose of this con-
figuration was to provide additional data on the possibility of improving telemetry
coverage, by using the FM receiver, during S-IC/S-II staging and interstage jettison.
There was no loss of data through the FM receiver at staging. On the other hand, the
same event caused a 9-second loss of data at the PM receiver output (fig. 6-1). However,
receivers. the loss of data at interstage jettison was approximately the same for both types of

Figure 6-1. - Concluded.
The television transmission attempted during the first pass over the Goldstone
station was unsuccessful because of a shorted patch cable in the ground station televi-
sion equipment. Also, the tracking coverage during this pass was limited to approxi-
mately 3 minutes by terrain obstructions. All subsequent transmissions provided
high-quality television.
The U.S.N.S. Redstone and Mercury and the Hawaii station provided adequate coverage
of translunar injection. A late handover of the command module and instrument unit up
links from the U.S.N.S. Redstone to the U.S.N.S. Mercury and an early handover of both
up links from the U.S.N.S. Mercury to the Hawaii station were performed because of
command computer problems at the U.S.N.S. Mercury. Approximately 58 seconds of command
module data were lost during these handovers. The loss of data during the handover from
the U.S.N.S. Mercury to the Hawaii station was caused by terrain obstructions.
Communications between the command module and the ground were lost during a portion
of transposition and docking because the crew failed to switch omnidirectional antennas
during the pitch maneuver. Two-way phase lock was regained when the crew acquired the
high-gain antenna in the narrow beamwidth. The telemetry data recorded on board the
spacecraft during this phase were subsequently played back to the ground. Between
3-1/2 and 4 hours, the down-link voice received at the Mission Control Center was
distorted by equipment failures within the Goldstone station.
During the fourth lunar orbit revolution, lunar module communications equipment was
activated for the first time. Good-quality normal and backup down-voice and high- and
low-bit-rate telemetry were received through the 210-foot antenna at Goldstone, Califor-
nia, while the spacecraft was transmitting through an omnidirectional antenna. As
expected, telemetry decommutation frame synchronization could not be maintained in the
high-bit-rate mode by using the 85-foot antenna at Goldstone for reception.
Between acquisition of the lunar module signal at 102:16:30 and the pitch-down
maneuver during powered descent, valid steerable antenna autotrack could not be achieved,
and received up-link and down-link carrier powers were 4 to 6 decibels less than nominal.
Coincidentally, several losses of phase lock were experienced (fig. 6-2). Prior to the
unscheduled yaw maneuver initiated at 102:27:22, the line of sight from the lunar module
steerable antenna to earth was obstructed by a reaction control thruster plume deflector.
(See "Steerable Antenna Acquisition" in section 16.) Therefore, in this attitude, the
antenna was more susceptible to incidental phase and amplitude modulation resulting from
66

--- PAGE 79 ---
multipath effects off either the lunar module or the. lunar surface. The sharp losses of
phase lock were probably caused by the buildup of oscillations in the steerable antenna
motion as the frequencies of the incidental amplitude and phase modulation approached
multiples of the antenna switching frequency (50 hertz). After the yaw maneuver, auto-
track with the correct steerable antenna pointing angles was not attempted until
102:40:12. Subsequently, valid autotrack was maintained throughout landing.

Figure 6-2.- Concluded.
As shown in figure 6-2, the performance of the down-link voice and telemetry channels
was consistent with the received carrier power. The long periods of loss of PCM synchro-
nization on data received at the 85-foot station distinctly illustrate the advantage of
scheduling the descent maneuver during coverage by a 210-foot antenna.
After landing, the lunar module steerable antenna was switched to the slew (manual)
mode and was used for all communications during the lunar surface stay. Also, the
Manned Space Flight Network was configured to relay voice communications between the
two spacecraft. This configuration provided good-quality voice while the command module
was transmitting through the high-gain antenna. However, the lunar module crewmen
reported that the noise associated with random keying of the voice-operated amplifier
within the Manned Space Flight Network relay configuration was objectionable when the
command module was transmitting through an omnidirectional antenna. This noise was
expected with operation on an omnidirectional antenna, and the use of the two-way voice
relay through the Manned Space Flight Network was discontinued, as planned, after the
noise was reported. During the subsequent extravehicular activity, a one-way voice
relay through the Manned Space Flight Network to the command module was utilized.
Primary coverage of the extravehicular activity was provided by the 210-foot antennas
at Goldstone, California, and Parkes, Australia. Backup coverage was provided by the
85-foot antennas at Goldstone, California, and Honeysuckle Creek, Australia. Voice com-
munications during this period were satisfactory; however, voice-operated-relay operations
caused breakup of the voice received at the Manned Space Flight Network stations. (See
"Network Performance" in section 13 and "Voice Breakup During Extravehicular Activity"
in section 16.) This breakup was primarily associated with the Lunar Module Pilot.
Throughout the lunar surface operation, an echo was heard on the ground 2.6 seconds after
68

--- PAGE 81 ---
the up-link transmissions because the up-link voice was turned around and transmitted on
the lunar module S-band down link. (See the subsection of section 16 entitled "Echo
During Extravehicular Activity.") The Parkes receiving station was largely used by the
Mission Control Center as the primary receiving station for real-time television trans-
missions. The telemetry decommutation system and the PAM-to-PCM converter maintained
frame synchronization on the lunar module telemetry data and the portable-life-support-
system status data, respectively, throughout the lunar surface activities.
An evaluation of data recorded by the Honeysuckle station during lunar surface
activities was accomplished to determine whether a station with an 85-foot antenna could
have supported this mission phase without deployment of the lunar module erectable anten-
na. The results of the evaluation were compared with those of a similar evaluation
recorded at the Goldstone station which used the 210-foot antenna. A comparison of slow-
scan television signals received at the two stations shows that although there was a
decibel difference in signal-to-noise ratios, there was no appreciable difference in
picture quality. The differences in down-link voice intelligibility and telemetry data
quality were not significant. There is no perceptible difference in the quality of
biomedical data received at the 85- and 210-foot stations. Playback of portable-life-
support-system status data for the Lunar Module Pilot shows that frame synchronization
was maintained 88 and 100 percent of the time for the stations with the 85- and the
210-foot antennas, respectively. Based on these comparisons, it is believed that the
ground station with the 85-foot antenna could have supported the lunar surface activities
without deployment of the erectable antenna, with slightly degraded data.
The performance of the communications system during the ascent and rendezvous phases
was nominal except for a 15-second loss of down-link phase lock at ascent engine ignition
The data indicate this loss can be attributed to rapid phase perturbations caused by
transmission through the ascent engine plume. During future Apollo missions, a wider
carrier tracking loop bandwidth will be selected by the Manned Space Flight Network sta-
tions prior to powered ascent. This change will minimize the possibility of loss of
phase lock because of rapid phase perturbations.

7. TRAJECTORY
The analysis of the trajectory from lift-off to spacecraft/S-IVB separation was
based on Marshall Space Flight Center results and Manned Space Flight Network tracking
data. After separation, the actual trajectory information was based on the best-estimate
trajectory generated after the flight from Manned Space Flight Network tracking and telem-
etry data.
The earth and moon models used for the trajectory analysis are described geometri-
cally as follows: (1) The earth model is a modified seventh-order expansion containing
geodetic and gravitational constants representative of the Fischer ellipsoid, and (2) the
moon model is a spherical harmonic expansion containing the R2 potential function, which
is defined in reference 1. Table 7-I defines the trajectory and maneuver parameters.

Launch Phase
The launch trajectory was essentially nominal and was approximately identical to
that of Apollo 10. A maximum dynamic pressure of 735 1b/ft 2 was experienced. The S-IC
center and outboard engines and the S-IVB engine cut off within 1 second of the planned
times, and the S-II outboard engine cut off 3 seconds early. At S-IVB cut-off, the
altitude was high by 9100 feet, the velocity was low by 6.0 ft/sec, and the flight-path
angle was high by 0.01°. All of these variations were within the expected dispersions.
Earth Parking Orbit
Earth parking orbit insertion occurred at 0:11:49.3. The parking orbit was per-
turbed by low-level hydrogen venting of the S-IVB stage until 2:34:38, the time of S-IVB
restart preparation.
Translunar Injection
The S-IVB was reignited for the translunar ejection maneuver at 2:44:16.2, or within
1 second of the predicted time, and cut-off occurred at 2:50:03. All parameters were
nominal, as shown in figure 7-1.

Maneuver Analysis
The parameters derived from the best-estimate trajectory for each spacecraft maneu-
ver executed during the translunar, lunar orbit, and transearth coast phases are pre-
sented in table 7-II. Tables 7-III and 7-IV present the respective pericynthion and
free-return conditions after each translunar maneuver. The free-return results indicate
conditions at entry interface produced by each maneuver, assuming no additional orbit
perturbations. Tables 7-V and 7-VI present the respective maneuver summaries for the
lunar orbit and the transearth coast phases.
Translunar injection.- The pericynthion altitude resulting from translunar injection
was 896.3 miles, as compared with the preflight prediction of 718.9 miles. This alti-
tude difference is representative of a 1.6-ft/sec accuracy in the injection maneuver.
The associated free-return conditions show an earth capture of the spacecraft.
Separation and docking.- The command and service modules separated from the S-IVB
and successfully completed the transposition and docking sequence. The spacecraft were
ejected from the S-IVB at 3 hours 17 minutes. The effect of the 0.7-ft/sec ejection
maneuver was a change in the predicted pericynthion altitude to 827.2 miles. The sepa-
ration maneuver performed by the service propulsion system was executed precisely and on
time. The resulting trajectory conditions indicate a pericynthion altitude reduction to
180.0 miles, as compared to the planned value of 167.7 miles. The difference indicates
a 0.24-ft/sec execution error.
Translunar midcourse correction.- The computed midcourse correction for the first
option point was only 17.1 ft/sec. A real-time decision was made, therefore, to delay
the first midcourse correction until the second option point at translunar injection plus
24 hours because of the small increase to only 21.2 ft/sec in the corrective velocity
required. The first and only translunar midcourse correction was initiated on time and
resulted in a pericynthion altitude of 61.5 miles, as compared with the desired value of
60.0 miles. Two other opportunities for midcourse correction were available during the
translunar phase, but the velocity changes required to satisfy planned pericynthion alti-
tude and nodal position targets were well below the levels at which normal lunar orbit
insertion can be retargeted. Therefore, no further translunar midcourse corrections
were required. The translunar trajectory was similar to that of Apollo 10.
Lunar orbit insertion and circularization. The lunar orbit insertion and circulari-
zation targeting philosophy for Apollo 11 differed from that of Apollo 10 in two ways.
First, targeting for the landing-site latitude was biased to account for the orbit
plane regression observed in Apollo 10, and second, the circularization maneuver was
targeted for a noncircular orbit of 65.7 by 53.7 miles, as compared with the 60-mile
circular orbit targeted for Apollo 10. A discussion of these considerations is presented
in "Lunar Orbit Targeting" in section 7. The representative ground track of the space-
craft during the lunar orbit phase of the mission is shown in figure 7-2.
The sequence of events for lunar orbit insertion was initiated on time, and the
orbit achieved as 169.7 by 60.0 miles. The firing duration was 4.5 seconds less than
predicted because of higher-than-predicted thrust. (See "Service Propulsion" in sec-
tion 8.)
72

--- PAGE 85 ---
The circularization maneuver was initiated two revolutions later and achieved the
desired target orbit to within 0.1 mile. The spacecraft was placed into a 65.7-by
53.8-mile orbit, with pericynthion at approximately 80° W, as planned. The R2 orbit
prediction model predicted a spacecraft orbit at 126 hours (revolution 13) of 59.9 by
59.3 miles. However, the orbit did not circularize during this period (fig. 7-3). The
effects of the lunar potential were sufficient to cause this prediction to be in error
by approximately 2.5 miles. The actual spacecraft orbit at 126 hours was 62.4 by
56.6 miles.
Undocking and command module separation.- The lunar module was undocked from the
command module during lunar revolution 13 at approximately 100 hours. The command and
service modules then performed a three-impulse separation sequence, with an actual
firing time of 9 seconds and a velocity change of 2.7 ft/sec. As reported by the crew,
the lunar module trajectory perturbations resulting from undocking and station keeping
were not compensated for in the descent orbit insertion maneuver one-half revolution
later. These errors directly affected the lunar module state-vector accuracy at the
initiation of powered descent.
Lunar module descent.- The descent orbit insertion maneuver was executed at
101.5 hours, and approximately 57 minutes later, the powered descent sequence began.
The detailed trajectory analysis for the lunar module descent phase is presented in
"Descent Trajectory Logic" in section 5. The trajectory parameters and maneuver results
are presented in tables 7-II and 7-V.
Lunar module ascent and rendezvous.- The lunar module ascent stage lifted off the
lunar surface at 124:22:00.8 after staying on the surface for 21 hours 36.35 minutes.
The lunar orbit insertion and rendezvous sequence were normal. The terminal phase was
completed by 128 hours. The detailed trajectory analysis for ascent and rendezvous is
presented in "Ascent" and "Rendezvous" in section 5. Tables 7-II and 7-V present the
trajectory parameters and maneuver results for these phases.
Transearth injection.- The transearth injection maneuver was initiated on time and
achieved a velocity change of only 1.2 ft/sec less than planned. This maneuver exceeded
the planned duration by 3.4 seconds because of a slightly lower-than-expected
thrust. (See "Service Propulsion" in section 8.) The transearth injection would not
have achieved acceptable earth entry conditions. The resulting perigee altitude solution
was 69.4 miles, as compared with the nominal value of 20.4 miles.
Transearth midcourse correction.- At the fifth midcourse-correction option point,
the first and only transearth midcourse correction of 4.8 ft/sec was made with the reac-
tion control system, and the trajectory was corrected to the predicted entry flight-path
angle of -6.51°.

Command Module Entry
The best-estimate trajectory for the command module during entry was obtained from
a digital postflight reconstruction. The onboard telemetry recorder was inoperative
during entry, and, because the spacecraft experienced communications blackout during the
first portion of entry, complete telemetry information was not recorded. An Apollo
range instrumentation aircraft received a small amount of data soon after the entry
interface was reached and again approximately 4 minutes into the entry. These data,
combined with the best-estimate trajectory, produced the postflight data presented in
this report. Table 7-VII presents the actual conditions at entry interface. The
flight-path angle at entry was 0.03° shallower than predicted at the last midcourse
correction, which caused a peak load factor of 6.56g that was slightly higher than
planned. The spacecraft landed in the Pacific Ocean at longitude 169.15° 4 and
latitude 13.30° N.

Service Module Entry
The service module entry was recorded on film by aircraft. This film shows the
service module entering the atmosphere of the earth and disintegrating near the command
module. According to preflight predictions, the service module should have skipped out
of the atmosphere into a highly elliptical orbit. The Apollo 11 crew observed the serv-
ice module approximately 5 minutes after separation and indicated that the reaction con-
trol thrusters were firing and that the module was rotating. A more complete discussion
of this anomaly is presented in "Service Module Entry" in section 16.

Lunar Orbit Targeting
The targeting philosophy for the lunar orbit insertion maneuver differed in two ways
from that of Apollo 10. First, the landing-site latitude targeting was biased in an
attempt to account for the orbit plane regression noted in Apollo 10. During Apollo 10,
the lunar module passed approximately 5 miles south of the landing site on the low-
altitude pass following descent orbit insertion. The Apollo 11 target bias of -0.37° in
latitude was based on the Langley Research Center 13th-degree, 13th-order lunar gravity
model. Of all gravity models investigated, this one came the closest to predicting the
orbit inclination and longitude of ascending node rates observed from Apollo 10 data.
During the lunar landing phase in revolution 14, the lunar module latitude was 0.078°
north of the desired landing-site latitude. A large part of this error resulted because
the targeted orbit was not achieved at lunar orbit insertion. The difference between
the predicted and actual values was approximately 0.05°, which represents the prediction
error from the 13th-degree, 13th-order model over 14 revolutions. However, the amount of
lunar module plane change required during descent was reduced from the 0.337° that would
have been required for a landing during Apollo 10 to 0.078° in Apollo 11 by biasing the
lunar orbit insertion targeting. A comparison between Apollo 10 and 11 latitude target-
ing results is presented in table 7-VIII.
The second change from Apollo 10 targeting was that the circularization maneuver
was targeted for a noncircular orbit of 53.7 by 65.7 miles. The R2 lunar potential model
predicted this orbit would decay to a 60-mile circular orbit at nominal time for rendez-
vous, thereby conserving ascent stage propellants. Although the R2 model is currently
the best for predicting inplane orbital elements, it cannot predict accurately over long
intervals. Figure 7-3 shows that the R2 predictions, using the revolution 3 vector,
matched the observed altitudes for approximately 12 revolutions. It should be noted that
the service module reaction-control-system separation maneuver in lunar orbit was taken
into account for both the circularization targeting and the R2 prediction. Estimates
show that if the spacecraft had been placed into a nearly circular orbit, as in Apollo 10,
a degenerated orbit of 55.7 by 67.3 miles would have resulted by the time of rendezvous.
The velocity penalty at the constant differential height maneuver for the Apollo 10
approach would have been at least 23 ft/sec, as compared to the actual 8 ft/sec resulting
from the executed circularization targeting scheme. A comparison between Apollo 11 and
Apollo 10 circularization results is presented in table 7-IX.

Lunar Orbit Navigation
The preflight plan for lunar orbit navigation, based on Apollo 8 and 10 postflight
analyses, was to fit tracking data from two near-side lunar passes with the orbit plane
constrained to the latest one-pass solution. For descent targeting, it was planned to
use the landing-site coordinates determined from landmark sightings during revolution 12
if it appeared that the proper landmark had been tracked. If not, the best-estimate pre-
flight coordinates from Lunar Orbiter data and Apollo 10 sightings were to be used. In
addition, these coordinates were to be adjusted to account for a two-revolution propaga-
tion of radial errors determined in revolutions 3 to 10. The predicted worst-case esti-
mate of navigation accuracy was approximately 3000 feet in both latitude and longitude.
Several unanticipated problems severely affected navigation accuracy. First,
greater inconsistency and larger errors were observed in the one-pass orbit plane esti-
mates than had been observed on any previous mission (fig. 7-4). These errors were the
result of a known deficiency in the R2 lunar potential model. This condition should not
occur on future missions because different lunar inclination angles will be flown.
A second problem, closely related to the first, was that the two-revolution propaga-
tion errors for crosstrack, or latitude, errors were extremely inconsistent. The average
propagation error based on five samples at the end of revolution 10 was 2900 feet, but
the uncertainty in this estimate was +9000 feet. Conversely, the propagation errors for
radial and downtrack, or longitude, errors were within expected limits. No adjustment
was made for either latitude or longitude propagation errors because of the large uncer-
tainty in the case of latitude and the small correction (800 feet) required in the case
of longitude.
The coordinates obtained from the landmark tracking during revolution 12 deviated
from the best preflight estimate of the center of the landing-site ellipse by 0.097° N,
0.0147° E, and 0.038 mile below. These errors are attributed to the R2 potential model
deficiencies. The large difference in latitude resulted from an error in the spacecraft
state-vector estimate of the orbit plane; these were the data used to generate the
sighting angles. The difference in longitude could also have been caused by an error in
the estimated state vector or by tracking of the wrong landmark.
81

--- PAGE 94 ---
The third problem area was the large number of trajectory perturbations in revolu-
tions 11 to 13 because of uncoupled attitude maneuvers, such as hot-firing tests of the
lunar module thrusters, undocking impulse, station-keeping activity, sublimator operation
and possibly tunnel and cabin venting. The net effect of these perturbations was a siz-
able down-range miss.
A comparison of the lunar landing point coordinates generated from various data
sources is presented in table 5-IV. The difference, or miss distance, was 0.0444° S and
0.2199° E, or approximately 4440 and 21 990 feet, respectively. The miss in latitude was
caused by neglecting the two-revolution orbit plane propagation error, and the miss in
longitude resulted from the trajectory perturbations during revolutions 11 to 13.
The coordinates used for ascent targeting were the best preflight estimate of
landing-site radius and the onboard-guidance estimate of latitude and longitude at touch-
down (corrected for initial state-vector errors from ground tracking). The estimated
errors in targeting coordinates were a radius 1500 feet less than desired and a longitude
4400 feet to the west.

8. PERFORMANCE OF THE COMMAND AND SERVICE MODULES
The performance of the command and service modules is discussed in this section.
The sequential, pyrotechnic, thermal protection, earth landing, power distribution, and
emergency detection systems operated as intended and are not discussed further. Discrep-
ancies and anomalies are generally mentioned in this section, but are discussed in greater
detail in section 16. Descriptive and historical information about the command and ser-
vice modules is given in appendix B.
Structural and Mechanical Systems
At earth lift-off, measured winds, both at the 60-foot level and in the region of
maximum dynamic pressure, indicated that structural loads were well below the established
limits. During the first stage of flight, accelerations measured in the command module
were nominal and similar to those measured during the Apollo 10 mission. The predicted
and calculated spacecraft loads (1) at lift-off, (2) in the region of maximum dynamic
pressure, (3) at the end of first-stage boost, and (4) during staging are shown in ta-
ble 8-I.
Command module accelerometer data indicate that sustained low-frequency longitudinal
oscillations were limited to 0.15g during S-IC boost. Structural loads during S-II and
S-IVB boost, translunar injection, both docking operations, all service propulsion ma-
neuvers, and entry were well within design limits.
As with all other mechanical systems, the docking system performed as required for
both the translunar and the lunar orbit docking events. The information given in ta-
ble 8-II concerning the two docking operations at contact is based upon crew comments.
The probe retract time for both events was between 6 and 8 seconds. During the gas re-
tract phase of the lunar orbit docking, the crew detected a relative yaw misalinement
that was estimated to have been as much as 15°. (See "Rendezvous" in sections 4 and 5
for further discussion of the docking system.) The unexpected vehicle motions were not
precipitated by the docking hardware and did not prevent accomplishment of a successful
hard dock. Computer simulations of the lunar orbit docking event indicate that the ob-
served vehicle misalinements can be caused by lunar module plus X thrusting after the
and Control" in this section.)

Electrical Power
Batteries.- The bus voltages of the entry and pyrotechnic batteries were maintained
at normal levels, and battery charging was nominal. All three entry batteries contained
the cellophane separators; whereas, only battery B used this type of separator for the
Apollo 10 mission. The improved performance of the cellophane separators is evident from
voltage/current data, which show, at a 15-ampere load, that the cellophane-type batteries
maintain an output 1 to 2 volts higher than the Permion-type batteries.
The only departure from expected performance occurred when battery A was placed on
main bus A for the translunar midcourse correction. During this maneuver, the normal
current supplied by each battery is between 4 and 8 amperes, but the current from bat-
tery A was initially 25 amperes and gradually declined to approximately 10 amperes just
prior to removal from the main bus. This occurrence can be explained by consideration of
two conditions: (1) Fuel cell 1 on main bus A had a lower than average skin temperature
(400° F), which caused it to deliver less current than usual, and (2) battery A had been
fully charged just prior to the maneuver. Both these conditions combined to result in
the higher-than-usual current delivery by battery A. Performance was normal thereafter.
The total battery capacity was maintained continuously above 103 A-h until separation of
the command module from the service module.
Fuel cells.- The fuel cells and radiators performed satisfactorily during the pre-
launch and flight phases. All three fuel cells were activated 68 hours prior to launch,
and after a 3.5-hour conditioning load, they were placed on open-circuit inline heater
operation until 3 hours prior to launch. After that time, the fuel cells provided full
spacecraft power.
During the 195 hours of the mission, the fuel cells supplied approximately 393 kWh
of energy at an average spacecraft current of 68.7 amperes (22.9 amperes per fuel cell)
and an average command module bus voltage of 29.4 volts. The maximum deviation from
equal load sharing between individual fuel cells was an acceptable 4.5 amperes.

--- PAGE 98 ---
All thermal parameters, including condenser exit temperature, remained within nor-
mal operating ranges and agreed favorably with predicted flight values. The condenser
exit temperature on fuel cell 2 fluctuated periodically every 3 to 8 minutes throughout
the flight. This disturbance was similar to that noted on all other flights and has been
shown to have no effect on fuel cell performance.
Cryogenic Storage
The cryogenic storage system satisfactorily supplied reactants to the fuel cells and
metabolic oxygen to the environmental control system. At launch, the total oxygen quan-
tity was 615 pounds (79 pounds above the minimum redline limit), and the hydrogen quan-
tity was 54.1 pounds (1.0 pound above the minimum redline limit). The overall consumption
from the system was nominal during the flight.
One heater in oxygen tank 2 was discovered to be inoperative. Records show that it
had failed between the times of the countdown demonstration test and the actual count-
down, and current measurements indicate that the element had an open circuit. This anom-
aly is discussed in detail in section 16.
Very-High-Frequency Ranging
The operation of the vhf ranging system was nominal during descent and from lunar
lift-off until orbital insertion. Following insertion, several tracking dropouts were
experienced. These dropouts resulted from negative circuit margins which were caused by
the use of the lunar module aft vhf antenna instead of the forward vhf antenna. After
the antennas were switched, vhf ranging operation returned to normal. A maximum range
of 246 miles was measured, and a comparison of the vhf ranging data with rendezvous-radar
data and the predicted trajectory showed close agreement.
Instrumentation
The instrumentation system - including the data storage equipment, the central tim-
ing equipment, and the signal conditioning equipment - supported the mission. The data
storage equipment did not operate during entry because the circuit breaker was open. The
circuit breaker that supplies ac power to the recorder also controls operation of the
S-band FM transmitter. When the television camera and associated monitor were to be
powered without transmitting to a ground station, the circuit breaker was opened to dis-
able the S-band FM transmitter. This breaker was inadvertently left open after the last
television transmission.
At approximately 5 hours 20 minutes into a scheduled cabin oxygen enrichment ("Low
Oxygen Flow Rate" in section 16), the oxygen flow-rate transducer indicated a low oxygen
flow rate. Comparison of the oxygen manifold pressure, oxygen-flow-restrictor differen-
tial pressures, and cryogenic oxygen values indicated that the flow-rate-transducer out-
put calibration had shifted downward. To compensate for the uncertainties associated
with the oxygen flow indications, cabin enrichment procedures were extended from 8 to
9 hours.

Guidance, Navigation, and Control
The command module guidance, navigation, and control system performance was satis-
factory throughout the mission. Earth launch, earth orbit, and translunar injection mon-
itoring functions were normal except that the crew reported a 1.5° pitch deviation from
the expected flight director attitude indicator reading during the translunar injection
maneuver. The procedure was designed for the crew to aline the flight director attitude
indicator/orbit-rate drive electronics assembly at approximately 4 deg/min while the
launch vehicle maintained the local vertical. One error of 0.5° is attributed to the
movement of the S-IVB while the flight director attitude indicator and the orbit-rate
drive electronics were being alined. An additional 0.2° error resulted from an error in
orbit-rate drive electronics initialization. Furthermore, the reading accuracy of the
flight director attitude indicator is 0.25°. An additional source of error for the
Apollo 11 mission was a late trajectory modification that changed the ignition attitude
by 0.4°. The accumulation of errors from these four sources accounts for the error re-
ported by the crew. The present procedure is considered adequate; therefore, no change
is being prepared for later missions.
Transposition and docking.- Two unexpected indications reported by the crew later
proved to be the normal operation of the respective systems. The 180° pitch transposi-
tion maneuver was to be performed automatically under digital autopilot control with a
manually initiated angular rate. The crew reported that each time the digital autopilot
was activated, it stopped the manually induced rate and maintained a constant attitude.
The cause of the apparent discrepancy was procedural; although the digital autopilot was
correctly initialized for the maneuver, in each case, the rotational hand controller was
moved out of detent prior to enabling of the digital autopilot. Normally, when the out-
of-detent signal is received by the computer, the digital autopilot is switched from an
automatic to an attitude-hold function until it is reenabled. After four attempts, the
maneuver was initiated properly and proceeded according to plan.
The other discrepancy concerned the entry monitor system velocity counter. The crew
reported biasing the counter to -100 ft/sec prior to separation, thrusting forward until
the counter indicated 100.6, then thrusting aft until the counter indicated 100.5. After
the transposition maneuver, the counter indicated 99.1 rather than the expected 100.5.
The cause of this apparent discrepancy was also procedural. The transposition maneuver
was made at an average angular velocity of 1.75 deg/sec. The entry monitor system is
mounted approximately 12 feet from the center of rotation. The resulting centripetal
acceleration integrated over the time necessary to move 180° yields a 1.2-ft/sec velocity
change and accounts for the error observed. The docking maneuver following transposition
was normal, with only small transients.
Inertial reference system alinements.- The inertial measurement unit was alined as
shown in table 8-III. Results were normal and comparable to those of previous missions.
Translation maneuvers.- A summary of pertinent parameters for each of the service
propulsion maneuvers is contained in table 8-IV. All maneuvers were as expected, with
very small residuals. Monitoring of these maneuvers by the entry monitor system was
excellent, as shown in table 8-V. The velocity initializing the entry monitor velocity
counter prior to each firing is biased by the velocity expected to be accrued during
thrust tail-off. When in control of a maneuver, the entry monitor issues an engine-off
discrete signal when the velocity counter reaches zero in order to avoid an overburn,
and the bias includes an allowance for the predicted tail-off.
87

--- PAGE 100 ---
The crew was concerned about the duration of the transearth injection maneuver.
When the firing appeared to be approximately 3 seconds longer than anticipated, the crew
issued a manual engine-off command. Further discussion of this problem is contained in
"Service Propulsion" in this section. The data indicate that a computer engine-off dis-
crete signal appeared simultaneously with actual engine shutdown. Therefore, the manual
input, which is not instrumented, was either later than, or simultaneous with, the auto-
matic command.
Attitude control. - All attitude control functions were performed satisfactorily
throughout the mission. The passive thermal control roll maneuver was used during trans-
lunar and transearth coast.
After entry into lunar orbit and while still in the docked configuration, the crew
reported a tendency of the spacecraft to position itself along the local vertical with
the lunar module positioned down. This effect was apparently a gravity gradient torque,
which can be as large as 0.86 ft-1b when the longitudinal axis of the vehicle is oriented
45° from the local vertical. A thruster duty cycle of once every 15 to 18 seconds would
be consistent with a disturbance torque of this magnitude.
Midcourse navigation. - Midcourse navigation using star/horizon sightings was per-
formed during the translunar and transearth coast phases. The first two groups of sight-
ings, at 43 600 miles and at 126 800 miles, were used to calibrate the height of the
horizon for updating the computer. Although several procedural problems were encountered
during early attempts, the apparent horizon altitude was determined to be 35 kilometers.
Table 8-VI contains a synopsis of the navigation sightings performed.
Landmark tracking. - Landmark tracking was performed in lunar orbit as indicated in
table 8-VII. The objective of the sightings was to eliminate part of the relative uncer-
tainty between the landing site and the command module orbit and thus improve the ac-
curacy of descent targeting. The sightings also provided an independent check on the
overall targeting scheme. The pitch technique provided spacecraft control while the
sextant was in use. The landmark tracking program was also used to point the optics in
several unsuccessful attempts to locate and track the lunar module on the lunar surface.
(See "Postlanding Spacecraft Operations" in section 5.)
Entry. - The entry was performed under automatic control, as planned. No telemetry
data are available for the period during blackout; however, all indications are that the
system performed as intended.
The onboard calculations for inertial velocity and flight-path angle at the entry
interface, which were 36 195 ft/sec and -6.488°, respectively, compare favorably with the
36 194-ft/sec and -6.483° calculations determined from tracking. Figure 13-1 in sec-
tion 13 shows a summary of landing-point data. The onboard computer indicated a landing
at longitude 169°9' W and latitude 13°18' N, or 1.69 miles from the desired target point.
Because no telemetry nor radar was available during entry, a final evaluation of naviga-
tion accuracy cannot be obtained. However, a simulated best-estimate trajectory shows a
landing point 1.03 miles from the target and confirms the onboard solution. Indications
are that the entry monitor system performed as intended.
Inertial measurement unit performance. - Preflight performance of the inertial com-
ponents is summarized in table 8-VIII. This table also shows the average value of the
accelerometer bias measurements and gyro null bias drift measurements made in flight and
the accompanying updates.
88

--- PAGE 101 ---
The gyro drift compensation updates were not as successful as expected, probably be-
cause of the change in sign of the compensation values. With the change in the torquing
current, a bias difference apparently occurred as a result of residual magnetization in
the torquer winding. The difference was small, however, and had no effect on the mission.
Figure 8-1 contains a comparison of velocity measured by the inertial measurement
unit with that from the launch vehicle guidance system during earth ascent. These ve-
locity differences reflect the errors in the inertial component compensation values. One
set of error terms that would cause these velocity errors is shown in table 8-IX. The
divergence between the two systems is well within the expected limits and indicates ex-
cellent performance, although a momentary saturation of the launch vehicle guidance sys-
tem Y-axis accelerometer caused an initial 5-ft/sec error between the two systems. The
remainder of the divergence in this axis was caused primarily by a misalinement during
gyrocompassing of the spacecraft guidance system. The 60-ft/sec out-of-plane velocity
error at insertion is equivalent to a misalinement of 0.11°; this is corroborated by the
Z-axis gyro torquing angle calculated during the initial optical alinement in earth orbit.
Computer.- The computer performed as intended throughout the mission. A number of
alarms occurred, but all were caused by procedural errors or were intended to caution the
respective crewman.
Optics. - The sextant and the scanning telescope performed normally throughout the
mission. After the coelliptic sequence maneuver, the Command Module Pilot reported that,
after selecting the rendezvous tracking program (P20), the optics had to be "zeroed" be-
fore automatic tracking of the lunar module would begin. Data indicate that the optics
mode switch was in the COMPUTER position when the command module was set up for the con-
tingency mirror-image coelliptic sequence maneuver. In this maneuver program, the service
propulsion engine gimbals are trimmed by the computer through the digital-to-analog con-
verter outputs of the optics coupling data units. The same converters are used to drive
the sextant shaft and trunnion when the optics are in COMPUTER mode. The telescope is
mechanically linked to the sextant so that it is operated when the sextant is operated.
To avoid driving the optics with a gimbal drive signal, or vice versa, the computer issues
discrete signals which enable or disable the appropriate output. With the optics drive
disengaged, the trunnion in the sextant was observed (during preflight testing) to drift
toward the positive stop. The drift is caused by an antibacklash spring.
A register in the computer tracks trunnion position but is not large enough to pro-
vide an unambiguous value for the full range of allowable trunnion angles. Therefore,
the register is biased to provide unambiguous readouts for the normally used range of
-10° to +64.7°. In this case, the trunnion drifted beyond 64.7°, the register overflowed,
and the computer lost track of actual trunnion position. When the automatic optics posi-
tioning routine was entered after selection of the rendezvous tracking program (P20), the
computer drive commands, based on the invalid counter contents, drove the trunnion to the
positive stop. Zeroing the system reestablished synchronization and proper operation.
Entry monitor system. Operation of the entry monitor system was normal, although
one segment on the electroluminescent numerical display for the velocity counter failed
to operate during the mission. (See "Loss of Electroluminescent Segment in Entry Monitor
System" in section 16.)

Reaction Control
Service module.- Performance of the service module reaction control system was normal
throughout the mission. The total propellant consumed prior to the command module/service
module separation was 560 pounds, 30 pounds less than predicted. During all mission
phases, the system pressures and temperatures remained well within their normal operating
ranges.
At the time the command and service modules separated from the S-IVB, the crew re-
ported that the propellant isolation valve indicators for quad B indicated the "barber-
pole" position. This indication corresponds to at least one primary and one secondary
valve being in the closed position. Twenty to 30 seconds after closure, the crew re-
opened the valves according to the checklist procedures, and no further problems were
experienced. (See "Indicated Closure of Propellant Isolation Valves" in section 16.)
Command module.- After command module/service module separation, the crew reported
that the minus-yaw engine in system 1 was not responding properly to firing commands
through the automatic coils. Postflight data confirm that this engine produced low, but
detectable, thrust when the automatic coils were activated. Also, the response to direct
coil commands was normal, which indicates that, mechanically, the two valves were opera-
ting properly and that one of the two valves was operating when the automatic coils were
energized. Postflight tests confirmed that an intermittent circuit existed on a terminal
board in the valve electronics. ("Failure of Automatic Coil in One Thruster" in sec-
tion 16 contains a discussion of this anomaly.)
All measured system pressures and temperatures were normal throughout the mission,
and except for the problem with the yaw engine, both systems operated as expected during
entry. Approximately 1 minute after command module/service module separation, system 2
was disabled, and system 1 was used for entry control, as planned. Forty-one pounds of
propellant were used during entry.
Service Propulsion
Service propulsion system performance was satisfactory during each of the five ma-
neuvers, with a total firing time of 531.9 seconds. The actual ignition times and firing
durations are listed in table 8-IV. The longest engine firing was for 357.5 seconds dur-
ing the lunar orbit insertion maneuver. The fourth and fifth service propulsion firings
were preceded by a plus-X reaction control translation to effect propellant settling, and
all firings were conducted under automatic control.
The steady-state performance during all firings was satisfactory. The steady-state
pressure data indicate essentially nominal performance; however, the gaging system data
indicate a mixture ratio of 1.55 rather than the expected ratio of 1.60 to 1.61.
The engine transient performance during all starts and shutdowns was satisfactory.
The chamber pressure overshoot during the start of the spacecraft separation maneuver
from the S-IVB was approximately 120 psia, which corresponds to the upper specification
limit for starts requiring only one bank of propellant valves. On subsequent firings,
the chamber pressure overshoots were all less than 120 psia. During the separation
firing, minor oscillations in the measured chamber pressure were observed, beginning
approximately 1.5 seconds after the initial firing signal. However, the magnitude of
the oscillations was less than 30 psi (peak-to-peak), and by approximately 2.2 seconds
after ignition, the chamber pressure data indicated normal steady-state operation.
95

--- PAGE 108 ---
The helium pressurization system functioned normally throughout the mission. All
system temperatures were maintained within their redline limits without heater operation.
The propellant utilization and gaging system operated satisfactorily throughout the
mission. The mode selection switch for the gaging system was set in the normal position
for all service propulsion firings; as a result, only the primary system data were used.
The propellant utilization valve was in the NORMAL position during the separation and
first midcourse firings and for the first 76 seconds of the lunar orbit insertion firing.
At that time, the valve was moved to the INCREASE position and remained there through the
first 122 seconds of the transearth injection firing. The valve position was moved to
NORMAL for approximately 9 seconds and then to DECREASE for most of the remainder of the
transearth injection firing.
Figure 8-2 shows the indicated propellant unbalance, as computed from the data. The
indicated unbalance history should reflect the unbalance history displayed in the cabin,
within the accuracy of the telemetry system. As expected, based upon previous flights,
the indicated unbalance following the start of the lunar orbit insertion firing showed
decrease readings. The initial decrease readings were caused primarily by the oxidizer
level in the sump tank exceeding the maximum gageable height. This condition occurs be-
cause oxidizer is transferred from the storage tank to the sump tank as a result of he-
lium absorption from the sump tank ullage. This phenomenon, in combination with a known
storage tank oxidizer gaging error, is known to cause both the initial decrease readings
and a step increase in the unbalance at crossover. The crewmen were briefed on these con-
ditions prior to flight and, therefore, expected both the initial decrease readings and a
step increase of 150 to 200 pounds at crossover. When the unbalance started to increase
(approach zero) prior to crossover, the crew, in anticipation of the increase, properly
interpreted the unbalance meter movement as an indication of a low mixture ratio and
moved the propellant utilization valve to the INCREASE position. As shown in figure 8-2,
the unbalance then started to decrease in response to the valve change, and at crossover,
the expected step increase occurred. At the end of the firing, the crew reported that
the unbalance was a 50-pound increase, which agrees well with the telemetered data shown
in figure 8-2. This early recognition of a lower mixture ratio and the movement of the
propellant utilization valve to the INCREASE position during lunar orbit insertion re-
sulted in a higher-than-predicted average thrust for the firing and in is duration of
4.5 seconds less than predicted.
The duration of the firing, as determined by Mission Control, was decreased to re-
flect the higher thrust level experienced on the lunar orbit insertion firing. However,
during the transearth injection firing, the propellant utilization valve was cycled from
the NORMAL to the DECREASE position twice. This transfer resulted in less than the ex-
pected thrust and consequently resulted in an overburn of 3.4 seconds beyond the recal-
culated transearth injection firing prediction.
Preliminary calculations, which were based on the telemetered gaging data and the
predicted effects of propellant utilization valve position, yielded mixture ratios for
the NORMAL valve position of approximately 1.55, compared to an expected range of 1.60
to 1.61. Less-than-expected mixture ratios were also experienced during the Apollo 9
and 10 missions, and sufficient preflight analyses were made prior to the Apollo 11 mis-
sion to verify that the propellant utilization and gaging system was capable of correcting
for mixture-ratio shifts of the magnitudes experienced. The reason for the less-than-
expected mixture ratios during the last three flights is still under investigation.
An abnormal decay in the secondary (system B) nitrogen pressure was observed during
the lunar orbit insertion service propulsion firing, which indicated a leak in the system
that operates the engine upper bipropellant valve bank. No further leakage was indicated
during the remainder of the mission. (This anomaly is discussed in greater detail in
"Service Propulsion Nitrogen Leak" in section 16.)

Environmental Control System
The environmental control system performed satisfactorily throughout the mission and
equipment. provided a comfortable environment for the crew and adequate thermal control of spacecraft
Oxygen distribution.- The cabin pressure stabilized at 4.7 psia prior to translunar
injection and returned to that value after initial lunar module pressurization. However,
two master alarms indicating high oxygen flow occurred during lunar module pressurization
when the oxygen flow rate was decreasing. This condition was also experienced during
ground testing. Postflight analysis has shown that this condition was caused by a mal-
function of the oxygen flow rate transducer. (See "Oxygen Flow Master Alarms" in
section 16.)
Particulate backcontamination control. - The command module oxygen systems were used
for particulate lunar surface backcontamination control from final command module docking
until earth landing. At approximately 128 hours, the oxygen flow rate was adjusted to an
indicated reading of approximately 0.6 1b/hr to establish a positive differential pressure
between the two spacecraft; this adjustment caused the cabin pressure to increase to about
5.4 psia. The oxygen purge was terminated at 130 hours 9 minutes following the command
module tunnel hatch leak check.
97

--- PAGE 110 ---
Thermal control - The primary coolant system provided adequate thermal control for
crew comfort and for the spacecraft equipment throughout the mission. The secondary
coolant system was activated only during redundant component checks and the earth entry
chilldown. The evaporators were not activated during lunar orbit coast because the
radiators provided adequate temperature control.
At 105 hours 19 minutes, the primary evaporator outlet temperature had dropped to
31.5° F. Normally, the temperature is maintained above 42° F by the glycol temperature
control valve during cold temperature excursions of the radiator. (This discrepancy is
discussed in "Glycol Temperature Control Valve" in section 16.)
Water management. - Gas in the spacecraft potable water has been a problem on all
manned Apollo flights. On the Apollo 11 mission, a two-membrane water/gas separator was
installed on both the water gun and the outlet at the food preparation unit. The sep-
arators allow only gas to pass through one membrane into the cabin atmosphere, while the
second membrane passes only gas-free water to the outlet port for crew consumption. The
crew indicated that performance of the separators was satisfactory. Water in the food
bags and from the water pistol was nearly free of gas. Two interface problems were ex-
perienced during use of the separators. There is no positive lock between the water
pistol and the inlet port of the separator; thus, occasionally, the separator would not
remain in place while the water pistol was being used to fill a food bag. Also, the crew
commented that some provision for positively retaining the food bag to the separator out-
let port would be highly desirable. For future spacecraft, a redesign of the separator
will provide positive locking between the water pistol and the inlet port of the separa-
tor. Also, a change has been made in the separator outlet probe to provide an improved
interface with the food bag.
Crew Station
The displays and controls were adequate except that the mission clock in the lower
equipment bay ran slow, by less than 10 seconds over a 24-hour period, as reported by the
crew. The mission clocks have a history of slow operation, which has been attributed to
electromagnetic interference. In addition. the glass face was found to be cracked. This
problem has also been experienced in the past and is caused by stress introduced in the
glass during the assembly process.
The lunar module clock is identical to the command module clock. Because of the
lunar module clock problem discussed in "Mission Timer Stopped" in section 16, an
improved-design timer is being procured and will be incorporated in future command
modules.
Consumables
The predictions for consumables usage improved from mission to mission such that for
the Apollo 11 mission, all the command and service module consumable quantities were
within 10 percent of the preflight estimates.
Service propulsion propellant. - The service propulsion propellant usage was within
5 percent of the preflight estimate for the mission. The deviations which were expe-
rienced have been attributed to the variations in firing times. (See "Service Propulsion"
in this section.) In table 8-X, the loadings were calculated from gaging system readings
and measured densities prior to lift-off.
98

--- PAGE 111 ---
Reaction control propellant.- Reaction control system propellant usage predictions
and flight data agreed to within 5 percent.
Service module: The reaction control system propellant usage for the service module
was higher than expected during transposition and docking and during the initial set of
navigation sightings. This higher usage was balanced by efficient maneuvering of the
command and service modules during the rendezvous sequence, in which the propellant con-
sumption was less than predicted. The usages listed in table 8-XI were calculated from
telemetered helium tank pressure data by using the relationship between pressure, volume,
and temperature.
Command module: The reaction control system propellant usages for the command mod-
ule (shown in table 8-XI) were calculated from pressure, volume, and temperature
relationships.
Cryogenics.- The oxygen and hydrogen usages were within 5 percent of those predicted.
This deviation was caused by the loss of an oxygen tank heater element and by a reduced
reaction control system heater duty cycle. Usages listed in table 8-XII are based on
the electrical power produced by the fuel cells.
Water.- Predictions concerning the amount of water consumed in the command and serv-
ice modules are not generated for each mission because the system has an initial charge
of potable water at lift-off, and additional water is generated in the fuel cells in ex-
cess of the demand. Also, some water is dumped overboard, and some is consumed. The
water quantities loaded, consumed, produced, and expelled during the Apollo 11 mission
are shown in table 8-XIII.

9. PERFORMANCE OF THE LUNAR MODULE
A discussion of the lunar module systems performance is presented in this section.
The significant problems are discussed in detail in section 16. Descriptive and histori-
cal information about the lunar module is presented in appendix B.
Structural and Mechanical Systems
No structural instrumentation was installed on the lunar module; consequently, the
structural performance evaluation was based on lunar module guidance and control data,
cabin pressure data, command module acceleration data, photographs, and analytical
results.
Based on measured command module accelerations and on simulations using measured
wind data, the lunar module loads are inferred to have been within structural limits
during the S-IC, S-II, and S-IVB launch phase firings and during the S-IVB translunar
injection maneuvers. The loads during both dockings were also within structural limits.
Command module accelerometer data show minimal structural excitation during the service
propulsion maneuvers, which indicated that the lunar module loads were well within
structural limits.
The structural loading environment during lunar landing was evaluated from motion
picture film, still photographs, postflight landing simulations, and crew comments. The
motion picture film from the onboard camera showed no evidence of structural oscillations
during landing, and crew comments agree with this assessment. Flight data from the
guidance and propulsion systems were used in conducting the simulations of the landing.
(See "Landing Dynamics" in section 5.) The simulations and photographs indicate that
the landing-gear-strut stroking was very small and that the external loads developed
during landing were well within design values.
Thermal Control
The lunar module internal temperatures at the end of the translunar flight were
nominal and within 3° F of the launch temperatures. During the active periods, tempera-
ture response was normal, and all antenna temperatures were within acceptable limits.
The crew inspected the descent stage thermal shielding after the lunar landing and
observed no significant damage.
Electrical Power
The electrical power system performed satisfactorily. The dc bus voltage was
maintained above 28.8 volts throughout the flight. The maximum observed load was
81 amperes during powered descent initiation. Both inverters performed as expected.
The knob on the ascent-engine-arm circuit breaker was broken, probably by the aft
edge of the oxygen purge system hitting the breaker during preparations for extravehic-
ular activity. In any event, this circuit breaker was closed without difficulty when
required prior to ascent. (See "Broken Circuit Breaker Knob" in section 16.)
102

--- PAGE 115 ---
At staging, the descent batteries had supplied 1055 A-h of a nominal total capacity
of 1600 A-h. The difference in load sharing at staging was 2 A-h on batteries 1 and 2 and
23 A-h on batteries 3 and 4; both of these values are acceptable.
At lunar module jettison, the two ascent batteries had delivered 336 A-h of a nominal
total capacity of 592 A-h. The ascent batteries continued to supply power for a total
of 680 A-h at 28 V dc or higher.
Communications Equipment
The overall performance of the S-band steerable antenna was satisfactory. However,
some difficulties were experienced during descent of the lunar module. Prior to the
scheduled 180° yaw maneuver, the signal strength dropped below the tracking level, and
the antenna broke lock several times. After the maneuver was completed, new look angles
were set, and the antenna acquired the up-link signal and tracked normally until landing.
The most probable cause of the problem was a combination of vehicle blockage and multi-
path reflections from the lunar surface, as discussed in "Steerable Antenna Acquisition"
in section 16.
During the entire extravehicular activity, the lunar module relay provided good
voice and extravehicular mobility unit data. Occasional breakup of the Lunar Module
Pilot's voice occurred in the extravehicular communications system relay mode. The most
probable cause was that the sensitivity of the voice-operated relay of the Commander's
audio center in the lunar module was inadvertently set at less than the maximum specified.
(This anomaly is discussed in "Voice Breakup During Extravehicular Activity" in sec-
tion 16.) Also, during the extravehicular activity, the Manned Space Flight Network
received an intermittent echo of the up-link transmissions. This echo was most likely
caused by signal coupling between the headset and microphone. (A detailed discussion
of this anomaly is given in "Echo During Extravehicular Activity" in section 16.) After
crew ingress into the lunar module, the voice link was lost when the portable life
support system antennas were stowed; however, the data from the extravehicular mobility
unit remained acceptable.
Television transmission was good during the entire extravehicular activity, both
from the descent stage stowage unit and from the tripod on the lunar surface. The
signal-to-noise ratios of the television link were good. The television was turned off
after 5 hours 4 minutes of continuous operation.
Lunar module voice and data communications were normal during the lift-off from the
lunar surface. The steerable antenna maintained lock and tracked throughout the ascent.
Up-link signal strength remained stable at approximately -88 dBm.
Instrumentation
The performance of the operational instrumentation was satisfactory, with the
exception of the data storage electronic assembly (onboard voice recorder). When the
tape was played, no timing signal was evident, and the voice was weak and unreadable,
with a 400-hertz hum and a wideband noise background. (For further discussion of this
anomaly, see "Onboard Recorder Failure" in section 16.)
103

--- PAGE 116 ---
Guidance and Control
Power-up initialization. - The guidance and control system power-up sequence was
nominal except that the crew reported an initial difficulty in alining the abort guidance
system. The abort guidance system is alined in flight by transferring the inertial
measurement unit gimbal angles from the primary guidance system, and from these angles
establishing a direction cosine matrix. Prior to the first alinement after activation,
the primary system coupling data units and the abort system gimbal angle registers must
be zeroed to ensure that the angles accurately reflect the platform attitude. Failure
to zero could cause the symptoms reported. Another possible cause of the difficulty is
an incorrect setting of the orbital rate drive electronics mode switch. If this switch
is set in the ORBITAL RATE position, even though the orbital rate drive unit is powered
down, the pitch attitude displayed on the flight director attitude indicator will be
offset by an amount corresponding to the orbital rate drive resolver. No data are
available for the alinement attempt, and no pertinent information is contained in the
data before and after the occurrence. Because of the success of all subsequent alinement
attempts, hardware and software malfunctions are unlikely, and a procedural discrepancy
is the most probable cause of the difficulty.
Attitude reference system alinements.- Pertinent data concerning each of the
inertial measurement unit alinements are contained in table 9-I. The first alinement
was performed before undocking, and the command module platform was used as a reference
in correcting for the measured 2.05° misalinement of the docking interface. After
undocking, the alinement optical telescope was used to realine the platform to the same
reference, and a misalinement equivalent to the gyro torquing angles shown in table 9-I
was calculated. These angles were well within the go/no-go limits established preflight.

After the descent orbit insertion maneuver, an alinement check was performed by
making three telescope sightings on the sun. A comparison was made between the actual
pitch angle required for the sun marks and the angle calculated by the onboard computer.
The results were well within the allowable tolerance and again indicated a properly func-
tioning platform.
The inertial measurement unit was alined five times while on the lunar surface. All
three alinement options were used successfully and are listed as follows: (1) an aline-
ment using a gravity vector calculated by the onboard accelerometers and a prestored
azimuth, (2) an alinement using the two vectors obtained from two different star sightings,
and (3) an alinement using the calculated gravity vector and a single star sighting to
determine an azimuth.
The Lunar Module Pilot reported that the optical sightings associated with these
alinements were based on a technique in which the average of five successive sightings
was calculated by hand and then inserted into the computer. An analysis of these
successive sightings indicated that the random sighting error was small and that the only
significant trend observed in the successive sightings was lunar rate.
The platform remained inertial during the 17.5-hour period between the third and
fourth alinements. Because both of these alinements were to the same orientation, it is
possible to make an estimate of gyro drift while on the lunar surface. Drift was
calculated from three sources: the gyro torquing angles or misalinement, indicated at
the second alinement; the gimbal angle change history in comparison to that predicted
from lunar rate; and the comparison of the actual gravity tracking history of the onboard
accelerometers with that predicted from lunar rate. The results from the alinements
(table 9-II) indicate excellent agreement for the granularity of the data used.

The abort guidance system was alined to the primary system at least nine times
during the mission (table 9-III). The alinement accuracy, as determined by the Euler
angle differences between the primary and abort systems for the eight alinements avail-
able on telemetry, was within specification tolerances. In addition, the abort guidance
system was independently alined three times on the lunar surface by using gravity, as
determined by the abort system accelerometers, and by using an azimuth derived from an
external source. The resulting Euler angles are shown in table 9-IV. A valid comparison
following the first alinement cannot be made because the abort guidance system azimuth
was not updated. Primary guidance alinements following the second alinement were incom-
patible with the abort guidance system because the inertial measurement unit was not
105

--- PAGE 118 ---
alined to the local vertical. A comparison of the Euler angles for the third alinement
indicated an azimuth error of 0.08°. This error resulted from an incorrect azimuth value
received from the ground and loaded manually in the abort guidance system. The resulting
0.08° azimuth error caused an out-of-plane velocity difference between the primary and
abort systems at insertion. (See "Ascent" in section 5.)

Translation maneuvers.- All translation maneuvers were performed under the primary
guidance system control, with the abort guidance system operating in a monitor mode.
Significant parameters are contained in table 9-V. The dynamic response of the spacecraft
was nominal during descent and ascent engine maneuvers, although the effect of fuel slosh
during powered descent was greater than expected, based on preflight simulations. Slosh
106

--- PAGE 119 ---
oscillations became noticeable after the 180° yaw maneuver and gradually increased to
the extent that thruster firings were required for damping (fig. 5-11 in section 5). The
effect remained noticeable and significant until after the end of the braking phase, when
the engine was throttled down to begin rate-of-descent control. The slosh response has
been reproduced postflight by making slight variations in the slosh model damping ratio.

Rendezvous maneuvers after terminal phase initiation are discussed in section 5, based on crew reports.
Ignition and cut-off times are those commanded by the computer.
Reported by crew.
dNo data available.
The ascent maneuver was nominal, with the crew reporting the wallowing tendency
inherent in the control technique used. As shown in table 9-V, the velocity at insertion
was 2 ft/sec higher than planned. This higher velocity has been attributed to a differ-
ence in the predicted and actual tail-off characteristics of the engine.
The abort guidance system, as stated, was used to monitor all primary guidance
system maneuvers. Performance was excellent except for some isolated procedural problems.
The azimuth misalinement which was inserted into the abort guidance system prior to
lift-off and which contributed to the out-of-plane error at insertion is discussed in
"Attitude Reference System Alinements" in this section. During the ascent firing, the
abort guidance system velocity to be gained was used to compare with and to monitor the
primary system velocity to be gained. The crew reported that near the end of the inser-
tion maneuver, the primary and abort system displays differed by 50 to 100 ft/sec. A
107

--- PAGE 120 ---
similar comparison of the reported parameter differences has been made postflight and is
shown in figure 9-1. As indicated, the velocity difference was as large as 39 ft/sec and
was caused by lack of time synchronization between the two sets of data. The calculations
are made and displayed independently by the two computers, which have outputs that are
not synchronized. Therefore, the time at which a given velocity is valid could vary as
much as 4 seconds between the two systems. Both systems appear to have operated
properly.

Figure 9-1.- Comparison of primary guidance and abort guidance system
velocities during final ascent phase.
The abort guidance system performed satisfactorily during monitoring of rendezvous
maneuvers, although residuals after the terminal phase initiation maneuver were somewhat
large. The differences were caused by a 23-second-late initiation of the maneuver and
by relatively large attitude excursions induced because of the incorrect selection of
wide deadband in the primary system. The desired velocity vector in the abort guidance
system is chosen for a nominal time of rendezvous. If the terminal phase initiation
maneuver is begun at a time other than nominal and if the abort system is not retargeted,
the maneuver direction and magnitude will not be correct.

--- PAGE 121 ---
Attitude control.- The digital autopilot was the primary source of attitude control
during the mission, and it performed as designed. One procedural discrepancy occurred
during the 180° yaw maneuver after the start of powered descent. The yaw maneuver was
performed manually by using the proportional rate output of the rotational hand control-
ler. Because a low rate scale was erroneously selected for display, the maneuver was
begun and partially completed at less than the desired rate of 10 deg/sec. Continuing
the maneuver on the low rate scale would have delayed landing-radar acquisition. After
the problem was recognized, the high rate scale was selected, and the maneuver was com-
pleted as planned. The abort guidance system was used just prior to the second docking.
Performance was as expected; however, some difficulty was experienced during the docking.
(See "Rendezvous" in section 5.)
Primary guidance, navigation, and control system performance.- The inertial measure-
ment unit was replaced 12 days before launch, and the new unit exhibited excellent
performance throughout the mission. Table 9-VI contains the preflight history of the
inertial components for the inertial measurement unit. The accelerometer bias history
is shown in table 9-VII. An accelerometer bias update was performed prior to undocking,
with the results as shown in table 9-VII.

Visibility in orbit and on the lunar surface through the alinement optical telescope
was as expected. Because of the relative position of the earth, the sun, and the reflec-
tions off the lunar surface, only the left and right rear telescope detent positions were
usable after touchdown. Star recognition and visibility through these detents proved to
be adequate. The sun angle had changed by the time of lift-off, and only the right rear
detent was usable. This detent proved sufficient for the alinements made just prior to
lift-off. (See "Ascent" in section 5.)
The lunar module guidance computer performed as designed, except for a number of
unexpected alarms. The first alarm occurred during the power-up sequence when the display
keyboard circuit breaker was closed, and a 520 alarm (RADAR RUPT), which was not expected
at this time, was generated. This alarm, which has been reproduced on the ground, was
caused by a random setting of logic gates during the turn-on sequence. The 520 alarm has
a low probability of occurrence and is neither abnormal nor indicative of a malfunction.
The Executive overflow alarms that occurred during descent ("Powered Descent" in
section 5) are now known to be normal for the existing situation and are indicative of
the proper performance of the guidance computer. These alarms are discussed in
"Computer Alarms During Descent" in section 16.
Abort guidance system performance.- Except for procedural errors which degraded
performance to some extent, all required functions were satisfactory. Eight known state-
vector transfers from the primary system were performed. The resulting position and
velocity differences for three of the transfers are shown in table 9-VIII. With the
exception of one incorrect difference caused by an incorrect K-factor used to time-
synchronize the system, all state-vector updates were accomplished without difficulty.

The preflight inertial component test history is shown in table 9-IX. The inflight
calibration results were not recorded; however, just prior to the inflight calibration
(before loss of data), the accelerometer biases were calculated from velocity data and
known computer compensations. The shift between the preinstallation calibration data and
the flight measurements is shown in table 9-X. (The capability estimate limits are based
on current three-sigma capability estimates with expected measurement errors included.)

When telemetered data were regained after the inflight calibration and after powered
ascent, excellent accelerometer stability was indicated as shown in table 9-X. (The
capability estimate limits are based upon current three-sigma capability estimates with
expected measurement errors included.) Inflight calibration data on the gyros were
reported, and two lunar surface gyro calibrations were performed with the results shown
in table 9-XI. The degree of stability of the instruments was well within the expected
values.

The only hardware discrepancy reported in the abort guidance system was the failure
of an electroluminescent segment in one digit of the data entry and display assembly.
(This failure is discussed in "Electroluminescent Segment on Display Inoperative" in
section 16.)
113

--- PAGE 126 ---
Reaction Control
The performance of the reaction control system was satisfactory. The system pres-
surization sequence was nominal, and the regulators maintained acceptable outlet pressures
(between 178 and 184 psia) throughout the mission.
The crew reported thrust chamber assembly warning flags for three engine pairs.
The A2 and A4 flags occurred simultaneously during lunar module station-keeping prior
to descent orbit insertion. The B4 flag appeared shortly thereafter and also twice
just before powered descent initiation. The crew believed that these flags were accom-
panied by master alarms. The flags were reset by cycling of the caution and warning
electronics circuit breaker. (See "Reaction Control System Warning Flags" in section 16
for further discussion of these warning flags.)
The chamber pressure switch in reaction control engine B1D failed in the closed
mode approximately 8.5 minutes after powered descent initiation. The switch remained
closed for 2 minutes 53 seconds, then opened and functioned properly for the remainder
of the mission. The failure mode is believed to be the same as that on the Apollo 9 and
10 missions, that is, particulate contamination or propellant residue holding the switch
closed. The only potential consequence of the failure would have been the inability to
detect an engine failed in the off mode.
A master alarm was noted at 126:44:00, when seven consecutive pulses were commanded
on engine A2A without a pressure switch response. Further discussion of this discrepancy
is given in "Thrust Chamber Pressure Switches" in section 16.
Thermal characteristics were satisfactory, and all temperatures were within predicted
values. The maximum quad temperature was 232° F on quad 1 subsequent to touchdown. The
fuel tank temperatures ranged from 68° to 71° F.
Propellant usage, based on the propellant quantity measuring device, was 319 pounds,
compared with a predicted value of 253 pounds and the total propellant load of 549 pounds.
Approximately 57 of the 66 pounds in excess of the predictions were used during powered
descent. Figures 9-2 and 9-3 include total and individual system propellant consumption
profiles.

During powered ascent, the reaction control system was used in the ascent inter-
connect mode. The reaction control system used approximately 69 pounds of propellant
from the ascent propulsion tanks.
Descent Propulsion
The descent propulsion system operation was satisfactory for the descent orbit
normal. insertion and descent maneuvers. The engine transients and throttle response were
Inflight performance. - The descent orbit insertion maneuver lasted 30 seconds; the
resulting velocity change was 76.4 ft/sec. The engine was started at the minimum
throttle setting of 13.0 percent of full thrust and, after approximately 15 seconds, was
throttled to 40-percent thrust for the remainder of the firing.
The duration of the powered descent firing was 756.3 seconds, corresponding to a
velocity change of approximately 6775 ft/sec. The engine was at the minimum throttle
setting (13 percent) at the beginning of the firing and, after approximately 26 seconds,
was advanced to full throttle. There was approximately a 45-second data dropout during
115

--- PAGE 128 ---
this period, but crew reports indicated that the throttle-up conditions were apparently
normal. Figure 9-4 presents descent propulsion system pressures and throttle settings
as a function of time. The data have been smoothed and do not reflect the data dropout
and throttle fluctuations just before touchdown.

--- PAGE 129 ---
During the powered descent maneuver, the oxidizer interface pressure appeared to
oscillate as much as 67 psi peak to peak. The pressure continued to oscillate through-
out the firing, although over a smaller range (fig. 9-5); the oscillations were most
prominent at approximately 50-percent throttle. The fact that oscillations of this
magnitude were not observed in the chamber pressure or the fuel interface pressure
measurements indicates that they were not real. Engine performance was not affected.
Oscillations of this type have been observed at the White Sands Test Facility on similar
pressure measurement installations on numerous engines. The high-magnitude pressure
oscillations observed during the White Sands Test Facility tests were amplifications of
much lower pressure oscillations in the system. The phenomenon has been demonstrated
in ground tests where small actual oscillations were amplified by cavity resonance of a
pressure transducer assembly containing a tee with the transducer on one leg of the tee
and a cap on another leg. This assembly is similar to the interface pressure transducer
installation. The resonance conditions will vary with the amount of helium trapped in
the tee and with the throttle setting.

System pressurization.- The oxidizer tank ullage pressure decayed from 158 to 95 psia
during the period from lift-off to the first activation of the system at approximately
83 hours. During this period, the fuel tank ullage pressure decayed from 163 to 139 psia.
These decays, which resulted from helium absorption into the propellants, were within the
expected range.
The measured pressure profile in the supercritical helium tank was normal. The
preflight and inflight pressure rise rates were 8.3 and 6.4 psi/hr, respectively.
During propellant venting after landing, the fuel interface pressure increased
rapidly to an off-scale reading. The fuel line had frozen during venting of the super-
critical helium, trapping fuel between the prevalve and the helium heat exchanger; and
this fuel, when heated from engine soakback, caused the pressure rise. (See "High Fuel
Interface After Landing" in section 16 for further discussion of this problem.)
Gaging system performance.- During the descent orbit insertion maneuver and the
early portion of powered descent, the two oxidizer propellant gages indicated off-scale
(greater than the maximum 95-percent indication), as expected. The fuel probes, however,
indicated approximately 94.5 percent instead of reading off-scale. The propellant loaded
was equivalent to approximately 97.3 and 96.4 percent for oxidizer and fuel, respectively.
An initial low fuel reading had also occurred on the Apollo 10 mission. As the firing
continued, the propellant gages began to indicate consumption correctly. The tank 1 and
tank 2 fuel probe measurements agreed throughout the firing. The tank 1 and tank 2
oxidizer probe measurements agreed initially, but midway through the firing, they began
to diverge until the difference was approximately 3 percent. For the remainder of the
firing, the difference remained constant. The divergence was probably caused by oxidizer
flowing from tank 2 to tank 1 through the propellant crossover line as a result of an
offset in the spacecraft center of gravity.
The low-level light came on at 102:44:30.4, which indicated that approximately
116 seconds of total firing time remained, based on the sensor location. The propellant-
remaining time line from the low-level light indication to the calculated propellant
depletion is as follows.

The indicated time of 45 seconds to propellant depletion compares favorably with the
postflight calculated value of 50 seconds to oxidizer tank 2 depletion. The 5-second
difference is within the measurement accuracy of the system. The low-level signal was
triggered by the point sensor in either oxidizer tank 2 or fuel tank 2.

Ascent Propulsion
The ascent propulsion system was fired for 435 seconds from lunar lift-off to orbit
insertion. All aspects of system performance were nominal.
The regulator outlet pressure, which was 184 psia during the firing, returned to
the nominal lockup value of 188.5 psia after engine cut-off. Table 9-XII presents a
comparison of the actual and predicted performance. Based on engine flow rate data, the
engine mixture ratio was estimated to be 1.595. The estimated usable propellant remaining
at engine shutdown was 174 pounds of oxidizer and 121 pounds of fuel; these quantities
are equivalent to 25 seconds of additional firing time to oxidizer depletion.

ᵃPreflight prediction based on acceptance test data and assuming nominal system performance.
b Actual flight data with known biases removed.
After ascent propulsion system cut-off and during lunar orbit, the fuel and inter-
face pressures increased from their respective flow pressures to lockup and then con-
tinued to increase to approximately 3.6 psi for fuel and 11 to 12 psi for oxidizer.
Loss of signal occurred approximately 39 minutes after engine shutdown as the vehicle
went behind the moon. Pressure rises in the system were observed during both the
Apollo 9 and the Apollo 10 missions. This initial pressure rise after shutdown was
caused by a number of contributing factors, such as regulator lockup, heating of the
ullage gas, and vaporization from the remaining propellants.
At reacquisition of signal (approximately 1 hour 29 minutes after shutdown), drops
of approximately 6 and 3.6 psi had occurred in the oxidizer and fuel pressures, respec-
tively. Thereafter, the pressure remained at a constant level for the 4.5 hours that
the data were monitored. This behavior rules out leakage as a cause of the pressure
drops. The apparent pressure drops had no effect on ascent propulsion system performance
and were probably caused by a combination of ullage gas cooling, pressure transducer
drift as a result of engine heat soakback, and instrumentation resolution. At tempera-
tures higher than 200° F, the accuracy of the pressure transducer degrades to +4 percent
119

--- PAGE 132 ---
(+10 psia) rather than the normal +2 percent. A permanent shift may also occur at high
temperatures. Thermal analysis indicates that the peak soakback temperatures were
200° to 235° F. Errors which may be attributed to various sources include a transducer
shift of 4 percent (equivalent to +10 psi), a pulse-code-modulation resolution of
2 counts (equivalent to 2 psi), and a 1-psi ullage pressure change which is effective
only on the oxidizer side.
Environmental Control System
The environmental control system in the lunar module supported all lunar operations
satisfactorily, with only the following minor exceptions.
Routine water/glycol sampling during prelaunch activities showed the presence of
large numbers of crystals which were identified as benzathiazyl disulfide. These crystals
were precipitated from a corrosion inhibitor in the fluid. The environmental control
system was flushed and filtered repeatedly, but the crystallization continued. The fluid
was then replaced with one containing a previously omitted additive (sodium sulfite), and
the amount of crystallization decreased. A spacecraft pump package was run on a bench
rig with the fluid containing crystals, and the pump performance was shown to be unaf-
fected, even for long durations. During the test, the filter in the test package plugged,
and the bypass valve opened. Pump disassembly revealed no deterioration. It was then
demonstrated that the crystals, while presenting an undesirable contamination, were not
harmful to environmental control system operation. The flight performance of the heat
transport section was nominal. The investigation revealed that recently the corrosion
inhibitor formulation was slightly modified. For future spacecraft, water/glycol with
the original corrosion inhibitor formulation will be used.
Depressurization of the lunar module cabin through the bacteria filter during the
extravehicular activity required more time than predicted. The data indicate that the
cabin pressure transducer reading was high at the low end of its range; consequently,
the crew could have opened the hatch sooner if the true pressure had been known.
During the sleep period on the lunar surface, the crew reported that they were too
cold to sleep. Analysis of the conditions experienced indicated that once the crewmen
were in a cold condition, there was not enough heat available in the environmental control
system to return them to a comfortable condition. Ground tests have indicated that in
addition to the required procedural changes which are designed to maintain heat in the
suit circuit, blankets will be provided and the crew will sleep in hammocks.
Shortly after lunar module ascent, the crewmen reported that the carbon dioxide
indicator was erratic; therefore, they switched to the secondary cartridge. The crewmen
had also selected the secondary water separator because one crewman had reported water
in his suit. Evaluation of the erratic carbon dioxide readings indicated that the
carbon dioxide sensor had malfunctioned, and the circuit breaker was pulled. Erratic
operation in the past has been caused by free water in the optical section of the sensor.
Further discussion of both the erratic carbon dioxide readings and the water in the
crewman's suit is contained in "Indication of High Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure" and
"Water in One Suit" in section 16.
Radar
Performance of the rendezvous and landing radars was satisfactory, and antenna
temperatures were always within normal limits. Range and velocity were acquired by the
landing radar at slant ranges of approximately 44 000 and 28 000 feet, respectively.
The tracker was lost briefly at altitudes of 240 and 75 feet; these losses were expected
and are attributed to zero-Doppler effects associated with manual maneuvering.
120

--- PAGE 133 ---
Crew Station
Displays and controls.- The displays and controls supported the mission satisfac-
torily, except that the mission timer stopped during the descent. After being deenergized
for 11 hours, the timer was started again and operated properly throughout the remainder
of the mission. The most probable cause of this failure was a cracked solder joint.
This anomaly is discussed in greater detail in "Mission Timer Stopped" in section 16.
Crew provisions.- The Commander and Lunar Module Pilot were provided with communica-
tions carrier adapter eartubes (with molded earpieces) for use in the lunar module cabin.
The purpose of these earphone adapters was to increase the audio level to the ear; use
of the adapters is according to crewman preference. The Lunar Module Pilot used the
adapters throughout the lunar module descent and landing phase, but after landing, he
found the molded earpieces uncomfortable and removed them. The Commander did not use
adapters because his preflight experience indicated that audio volume levels were
adequate. The Apollo 10 Lunar Module Pilot had used the adapters during his entire
lunar module operational period and had reported no discomfort. The Apollo 12 crewmembers
were also provided adapters for optional use.
The crew commented that the inflight coverall garments would be more utilitarian if
they were patterned after the standard one-piece summer flying suit. More pockets with
a better method of closure, preferably zippers, were recommended and will be provided
for evaluation by future crews.
The crew reported that the lunar module windows fogged repeatedly while the sun-
shades were installed. They transferred two of the command module tissue dispensers to
the lunar module and used the tissues to clean the windows instead of using the window
heaters list. for defogging. Tissue dispensers are being added to the lunar module stowage
Consumables
On the Apollo 11 mission, the actual usage of only three consumables deviated by as
much as 10 percent from the preflight predictions. These consumables were the descent
stage oxygen, ascent stage oxygen, and reaction control system propellant. The actual
oxygen requirements were less than predicted because the leakage rate was lower than
expected. The actual reaction control propellant requirement was greater than predicted
because of the increased hover time during the descent phase.
The electrical power system consumables usage was within 5 percent of predicted
flight requirements. The usage of current from the descent stage batteries was approx-
imately 8 percent less than predicted, and the usage of current from the ascent stage
batteries was approximately 3 percent more than predicted. The deviations appear to
have resulted from uncertainties in the predicted usage for reaction control heater
duty cycles. Electrical power consumption is discussed further in "Electrical Power" in
this section.
Descent propulsion system propellant.- The higher-than-predicted propellant usage
by the descent propulsion system was caused by the maneuvering to avoid a large crater
during the final stages of descent. Until that time, propellant usage had been nominal.
Allowance for manual hover and landing-point redesignation was in the preflight budget
but was not considered part of the nominal usage.

Reaction control system propellant. The increased hover time for lunar landing
resulted in a deviation of over 10 percent in the reaction control system propellant
usage, as compared with the preflight predictions. Propellant consumption (shown in
table 9-XV) was calculated from telemetered helium tank pressure histories by using the
relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature. The mixture ratio was assumed
to be 1.94 for the calculations.

Oxygen.- - The actual oxygen usage was lower than the preflight predictions because
the oxygen leak rate from the cabin was less than the specification value. The actual
rate was 0.05 1b/hr, as compared with the specification rate of 0.2 lb/hr. In
table 9-XVI, the actual quantities loaded and consumed are based on telemetered data.
Water.- The actual water usage was within 10 percent of the preflight predictions.

10. PERFORMANCE OF THE EXTRAVEHICULAR MOBILITY UNIT
Performance of the extravehicular-mobility-unit was excellent throughout both intra-
vehicular and extravehicular lunar surface operations. Crew mobility was good during
extravehicular activity, and an analysis of inflight cooling system data shows good
correlation with ground data. The crew remained comfortable throughout the most stren-
uous surface operations. Because of the lower-than-expected metabolic rates, oxygen
and water consumption was below predicted levels throughout the extravehicular activities.
The pressure garment assemblies, including helmet and intravehicular gloves, were
worn during launch. The pressure garment assemblies of the Commander and Lunar Module
Pilot had been reconfigured with new arm bearings which contributed to the relatively
unrestricted mobility demonstrated during lunar surface operations.
The Command Module Pilot's pressure garment assembly did not fit in the lower
abdomen and crotch areas; the incorrect fit was caused by the urine collection and trans-
fer assembly flange. Pressure points resulted from insufficient size in the pressure
garment assembly. On future flights, fit checks will be performed with the crewman
wearing the urine collection and transfer assembly, the fecal containment system, and
the liquid cooling garment, as applicable. In addition, the fit check will include a
position simulating that which the crewman experiences during the countdown.
All three pressure garment assemblies and the liquid cooling garments for the
Commander and Lunar Module Pilot were donned at approximately 97 hours in preparation
for the lunar landing and lunar surface operations. Donning was accomplished normally
with the crewmen helping each other, as required. The suit integrity check prior to un-
docking was completed successfully, with suit pressures decaying approximately 0.1 psi.
Wristlets and comfort gloves were taken aboard for optional use by the Commander and
vironment, the light loads handled on this mission, and the short duration of the lunar
Lunar Module Pilot during the lunar stay. Because of the quick adaption to the 1/6-g en-
surface activity, both crewmen elected to omit the use of the protective wristlets and
comfort gloves. Without the protection of the wristlets, the Lunar Module Pilot's wrists
were rubbed by the wrist rings, and the grasp capability of the Commander was reduced
somewhat without the comfort gloves.
After attachment of the lunar module restraint, a pressure point developed on the
instep of the Lunar Module Pilot's right foot because the restraint tended to pull him
forward and out board rather than straight down. However, he compensated by moving his
right foot forward and out board; this foot then took the majority of the load. After
assessment of the Apollo 12 mission, a determination is to be made of whether corrective
action is required.
Extravehicular activity preparations proceeded smoothly. However, more time was
required than planned for completing the unstowage of equipment and performing other
minor tasks not normally emphasized in training exercises.
The oxygen-purge-system checkout was performed successfully. During pre-egress
activities, the crewmembers encountered difficulty in mating the remote-control-unit
connector and were required to spend approximately 10 minutes in mating each connector.
Each time the crewman thought the connector was alined, the lock lever caused the con-
nector to lean to one side and disengage. (This problem is discussed further in
"Mating of Remote Control Unit to Portable Life Support System" in section 16.)
Another difficulty was the bulk of the portable life support system. One circuit
breaker was broken, and the positions of two circuit breakers were changed when the
125

--- PAGE 138 ---
crewmembers accidentally bumped them with their portable life support systems as they
performed the pre-egress activities.
While waiting for the cabin to depressurize, the members of the crew were comfort-
able, even though the inlet temperature of the liquid cooling garment reached approxi-
mately 90° F prior to sublimator startup. No thermal changes were noted at egress.
The portable life support system and oxygen purge system were worn quite comfortably,
and the back-supported mass was not objectionable in the 1/6-g environment.
Analysis of the extravehicular activity data shows a good correlation with data from
previous training conducted in the Space Environmental Simulation Laboratory facility.
As expected, the feedwater pressure during the mission was slightly higher than that in-
dicated during simulations. The difference results from the lunar gravitational effect
on the head of water at the sublimator and transducer, the high point in the system.
The only other discernible differences were in temperature readouts, which generally in-
dicated better performance (more cooling) than expected. Comfort in the liquid cooling
garment was always adequate, although the data indicate a much higher temperature for
the Commander's garment than for the Lunar Module Pilot's garment. This observation
correlates with previous simulation experience which shows that the Commander had a
strong preference for a warmer body temperature than that desired by the Lunar Module
Pilot. This parameter is controlled by each crewman to meet his comfort requirements.
Operation of the extravehicular mobility unit while in the extravehicular mode was un-
eventful. The only change necessary to the control settings for the portable life sup-
port system was that of the diverter valves, which both crewmen changed at their option
for comfort.
Because of the lower-than-expected metabolic rates for the Lunar Module Pilot and
especially for the Commander, the actual oxygen and feedwater quantities consumed were
lower than predicted. Consumables data are shown in table 10-1.

Crewman mobility and balance in the extravehicular mobility unit were sufficient to
allow stable movement during performance of lunar surface tasks. The Lunar Module Pilot
demonstrated the capability to walk, run, change direction while running, and stop move-
ment without difficulty. He reported a tendency to tip backwards in the soft sand and
noted that he had to be careful to compensate for the different location of the center
of mass. The crewmen knelt down and contacted the lunar surface while retrieving objects.
The crew stated that getting down on one or both knees to retrieve samples and allow
closer inspection of the lunar surface should be a normal operating mode. Additional
waist mobility would improve the ability to get closer to the lunar surface and, in
addition, would increase downward visibility.
Each crewman raised his extravehicular visor assembly to various positions through-
out the extravehicular activity and noted a back reflection of his face from the visor.
The reflection was greatest with the sun shining approximately 90° from the front of
the visor assembly. With this reflection, it was difficult to see into shaded areas.
In addition, the continuous movement from sunlight into shadow and back into sunlight
required extra time because of the necessary wait for adaptation to changes in light
intensity. Use of the blinders on the visor assembly could have alleviated the reflec-
tion and adaptation problem to some extent.
127

--- PAGE 140 ---
11. THE LUNAR SURFACE
Preflight planning for the Apollo 11 mission included a lunar surface stay of ap-
proximately 22 hours, including 2 hours 40 minutes that were allotted to extravehicular
activities.
After landing, the crew performed a lunar module checkout to ascertain launch
capability and photographed the landing area from the lunar module. Then, following an
extensive checkout of the extravehicular mobility unit, the crewmen left the lunar
module to accomplish the following activities:
1. Inspection of the lunar module exterior
2. Collection of a contingency sample, a bulk sample, and documented samples of
lunar surface materials
3. Evaluation of the physical characteristics of the lunar surface and its effects
on extravehicular activity
4. Deployment of the solar wind composition experiment and, at the end of the
extravehicular activities, retrieval of the experiment for return to earth
5. Deployment of the early Apollo scientific experiments package, consisting of
the passive seismic experiment and the laser ranging retroreflector
Throughout the extravehicular activities, the crewmen made detailed observations
and took photographs to document their activites and the lunar surface characteristics.
A television camera provided real-time coverage of crew extravehicular activities. Al-
though the crewmen were operating in a new environment, they were able to complete the
activities at a rate very close to that predicted before flight (table 11-1).
Except for a portion of the planned documented sample collection not completed,
the lunar surface activities were totally successful, and all objectives were accom-
plished. As had been anticipated prior to flight, there was insufficient time for exact
performance of the documented sample collection. Two core samples and several loose
rock samples were collected and returned. There was also insufficient time to fill the
environmental and gas analysis sample containers, which were a part of the documented
sampling.
Minor equipment malfunctions and operational discrepancies occurred during the
extravehicular activity, but none prevented accomplishment of the respective tasks.
Conversely, several operations were enhanced, and equipment performance increased be-
cause of unexpected influences of the lunar environment.
The planned time line of major surface activities compared with the actual time
required is shown in table 11-1. Table 11-I lists the events sequentially, as presented
in the Lunar Surface Operations Plan, and also includes several major unplanned activ-
ities. Crew rest periods, system checks, spontaneous observations, and unscheduled
evaluations not necessarily related to the task being accomplished are not listed as
separate activities but are included in the appropriate times.
During deployment of the television camera, several activities were accomplished,
including some that were unplanned. The time line provided a minimum amount of time
for the Commander to (1) remove the thermal blanket on the equipment compartment,
(2) change the camera lens, (3) remove the tripod and camera from the compartment, and

minutes for (1) viewing selected lunar features, (2) positioning the camera to cover the
subsequent surface activities, and (3) returning to the compartment.
Throughout the extravehicular activity, both crewmen made observations and evalua-
tions of the lunar environment, including lighting and surface features as well as other
characteristics of scientific or operational interest. During the extravehicular activity,
the sun angle ranged from 14.5° to 16°. Most of the observations and evaluations will
provide valuable information for future equipment design, crew training, and flight
planning.
The evaluation of lunar surface experiments is contained in the following paragraphs.
Photographic results, including those related to specific experiments, are discussed both
in the appropriate sections and in a general description of lunar surface photography.

Lunar Geology Experiment
Summary. - The Apollo 11 spacecraft landed in the southwestern part of Mare Tranquil-
litatis at latitude 0°41'15" N and longitude 23°26' E (fig. 11-1), approximately 20 kilo-
meters southwest of the crater Sabine D. This part of Mare Tranquillitatis is crossed
by relatively faint, but distinct, north-northwest-trending rays (bright, whitish lines)
associated with the crater Theophilus, which lies 320 kilometers to the southeast
(ref. 2). The landing site is approximately 25 kilometers southeast of Surveyor V and
68 kilometers southwest of the impact crater formed by Ranger VIII. A fairly prominent
north-northeast-trending ray lies 15 kilometers west of the landing site. This ray may
be related to Alfraganus, 160 kilometers to the southwest, or to Tycho, approximately
1500 kilometers to the southwest. The landing site lies between major rays, but may
contain rare fragments derived from Theophilus, Alfraganus, Tycho, or other distant
craters.

--- PAGE 143 ---
About 400 meters east of the landing point is a sharp-rimmed ray crater, approxi-
mately 180 meters in diameter and 30 meters deep, which was unofficially named West
Crater. West Crater is surrounded by a blocky ejecta (material ejected from crater) apron
that extends almost symmetrically outward approximately 250 meters from the rim crest.
Blocks as large as 5 meters in diameter exist from on the rim to as far away from the rim
as approximately 150 meters, as well as in the interior of the crater. Rays of blocky
ejecta, with many fragments 0.5 to 2 meters across, extend beyond the ejecta apron west
of the landing point. The lunar module landed between these rays in a path that is rela-
tively free of extremely coarse blocks.
At the landing site, the lunar surface consists of fragmental debris ranging in size
from particles too fine to be resolved by the naked eye to blocks 0.8 meter in diameter.
This debris forms a layer that is called the lunar regolith. At the surface, the regolith
(debris layer) is porous and weakly coherent. It grades downward into a similar, but more
densely packed, substrate. The bulk of the regolith consists of fine particles, but many
small rock fragments were encountered in the subsurface as well as on the surface.
In the vicinity of the lunar module, the mare surface has numerous small craters
ranging in diameter from a few centimeters to several tens of meters. Just southwest of
the lunar module is a double crater 12 meters long, 6 meters wide, and 1 meter deep, with
a subdued raised rim. Approximately 50 meters east of the lunar module is a steep-walled,
but shallow, crater 33 meters in diameter and 4 meters deep which was visited by the Com-
mander near the end of the extravehicular period.
All of the craters in the immediate vicinity of the lunar module have rims, walls,
and floors of relatively fine-grained material, with scattered coarser fragments that
occur in about the same abundance as on the intercrater areas. These craters are up to
a meter deep and, because of the lack of blocky ejecta, appear to have been excavated
entirely in the regolith.
At the 33-meter-diameter crater east of the lunar module, the walls and rim have
the same texture as the regolith elsewhere; however, a pile of blocks was observed on the
floor of the crater. The crater floor may lie close to the base of the regolith. Sev-
eral craters of about the same size - with steep walls and shallow, flat floors or
floors with central humps - occur in the area around the landing site. From the depths
of these craters, the thickness of the regolith is estimated to range from 3 to 6 meters.
Coarse fragments are scattered in the vicinity of the lunar module in about the same
abundance as at the Surveyor I landing site in the Ocean of Storms at latitude 2°24.6' S
and longitude 48°18' W. The coarse fragments are distinctly more abundant than at the
other Surveyor landing sites on the maria, including the landing site of Surveyor V north-
west of the lunar module. The Surveyor I landing site was near a fresh blocky-rim crater
but beyond the apron of coarse blocky ejecta, as was the Apollo 11 site. It may be in-
ferred that many rock fragments in the immediate vicinity of the spacecraft, at both the
Surveyor I and the Apollo 11 landing sites, were derived from the nearby blocky-rim crater.
Fragments derived from West Crater may have come from depths as great as 30 meters beneath
the mare surface and may be direct samples of the bedrock from which the local regolith
was derived.
Rock fragments at the Apollo 11 landing site have a wide variety of shapes, and most
are embedded to varying degrees in the fine matrix of the regolith. Most of the rocks
are rounded or partially rounded on their upper surfaces, but angular fragments of irreg-
ular shape are also abundant. A few rocks are rectangular slabs with a faint platy
(parallel fractures) structure. Many of the rounded rocks, when collected, were found
to be flat or of irregular angular shape on the bottom. The exposed part of one unusual
rock, which was not collected, was described by the Commander as resembling an automobile
131

--- PAGE 144 ---
distributor cap. When this rock was dislodged, the sculptured "cap" was found to be the
top of a much bigger rock, the buried part of which was larger in lateral dimensions and
angular in form.
The evidence suggests that processes of erosion are taking place on the lunar sur-
face and that this erosion is leading to the gradual rounding of the exposed surfaces
of rocks. Several processes may be involved. On some rounded rock surfaces, the indi-
vidual clasts (fragmented material) and grains that compose the rocks and the glassy
linings of pits on the surfaces have been left in raised relief by general wearing away
or ablation of the surface. This
differential erosion is most prom-
inent in microbreccia (rocks con-
sisting of small sharp fragments
embedded in a fine-grained matrix).
The ablation may be caused primar-
ily by small particles bombarding
the surface.
Some crystalline rocks of me-
dium grain size have rounded sur-
faces that have been produced by
the peeling of closely spaced
exfoliation (thin, concentric
flakes) shells. The observed
"distributor cap" form may have
developed by exfoliation or by
spalling of the free surfaces of
the rock as a result of one or more
energetic impacts on the top
surface.
Minute pits from a fraction
of a millimeter to approximately
2 millimeters in diameter and from
a fraction of a millimeter to

1 millimeter deep occur on the
rounded surfaces of most rocks.

Regional geologic setting.- Mare Tranquillitatis has an irregular form (refs. 3
and 4). Two characteristics suggest that the mare material is relatively thin: (1) an
unusual ridge ring, named Lamont, located in the southwest part of the mare, may be
localized over the shallowly buried rim of a premare crater; and (2) no large positive
gravity anomaly, like those over the deep mare-filled circular basins, is associated with
Mare Tranquillitatis (ref. 5).
The southern part of Mare Tranquillitatis is crossed by relatively faint but distinct
north-northwest-trending rays and prominent secondary craters associated with the crater
Theophilus. Approximately 15 kilometers west of the landing site is a fairly prominent
north-northeast-trending ray. The ray may be related to either of the craters Alfraganus
or Tycho located 160 and 1500 kilometers, respectively, to the southwest.
A hill of highland-like material protrudes above the mare surface 52 kilometers
east-southeast of the landing site. This structure suggests that the mare material is
very thin in this region, perhaps no more than a few hundred meters thick.
Location of the landing site from transmitted geologic data.- The landing site was
tentatively identified during the lunar surface stay on the basis of observations trans-
mitted by the crew. The Commander reported avoiding a blocky crater the size of a foot-
ball field during landing and observed a hill that he estimated to be from 0.5 to 1 mile
west of the lunar module. The lunar module was tilted 4.5° E (backward) on the lunar
surface.
During the first pass of the command and service modules after lunar module landing
(approximately 1 to 1.5 hours after landing), the first of several different landing-site
locations, computed from the onboard computer and from tracking data, was transmitted to
the Command Module Pilot for visual search. (See section 5.) The first such estimate
of the landing site was northwest of the planned landing ellipse. The only site near
this computed location that could have matched the reported description was near North
Crater at the northwest boundary of the landing ellipse. However, this region did not
match the description very closely. Later, computed estimates indicated that the landing
site was considerably south of the earlier determination, and the areas near West Crater
most closely fit the description. These data were transmitted to the Command Module
Pilot on the last pass before lunar module lift-off, but the Command Module Pilot's ac-
tivities at this time did not permit visual search. The location just west of West Crater
was confirmed by rendezvous-radar tracking of the command module by the lunar module near
the end of the lunar stay period and by the descent photography.
The crater that was avoided during landing was reported by the crew to be surrounded
by ejecta containing blocks up to 5 meters in diameter and which extended 100 to 200 me-
ters from the crater rim, indicating a relatively fresh, sharp-rimmed ray crater. The
only crater in the 100- to 200-meter size range that meets the description and is in the
vicinity indicated by the radar is West Crater near the southwest edge of the planned
landing ellipse. A description by the Commander of a double crater approximately 6 to
12 meters in size and south of the lunar module shadow, plus the identification of West
Crater, the hill to the west, and the 21- to 24-meter crater reported behind the lunar
module, formed a unique pattern from which the landing site was determined to within
approximately 8 meters. The 21- to 24-meter crater has been since identified by photom-
etry as being 33 meters in diameter. The returned sequence-camera descent photography
confirmed the landing point location. The position corresponds to coordinates latitude
0°41'15" N and longitude 23°26'0" E on figure 5-10 (in section 5).
Geology from transmitted data.- The surface of the mare near the landing site is
unusually rough and of greater geologic interest than expected before flight. Television
pictures indicated a greater abundance of coarse fragmental debris than at any of the
four Surveyor landing sites on the maria except that of Surveyor I (ref. 6). It is
133

--- PAGE 146 ---
likely that the observed fragments and the samples returned to earth had been derived
from varying depths beneath the original mare surface and have had widely different his-
tories of exposure on the lunar surface.
The major topographic features in the landing area are large craters a few hundred
meters across, four of which are broad subdued features. The fifth large crater is West
Crater located 400 meters east of the landing point. Near the lunar module, the surface
is pocked by numerous small craters and strewn with fragmental debris, part of which may
have been generated during the impact formation of West Crater.
Among the smaller craters, both sharp, raised-rim craters and relatively subdued
craters are common. They range in size from a few centimeters to 20 meters. A slightly
subdued, raised-rim crater (the reported 21- to 24-meter crater) 33 meters in diameter
and 4 meters deep occurs approximately 50 meters east of the lunar module, and a double
crater (the reported doublet crater) approximately 12 meters long and 6 meters wide lies
10 meters west of the lunar module at a 260° azimuth (fig. 5-8).
The walls and floors of most of the craters are smooth and uninterrupted by either
outcrops or conspicuous stratification. Rocks present in the 33-meter crater are larger
than any of those seen on the surface in the vicinity of the lunar module. The bulk of
the surface layer consists of fine-grained particles which tended to adhere to the crew-
men's boots and suits, as well as to equipment, and which was molded into smooth forms
in the footprints.
The regolith is weak and relatively easily trenched to depths of several centimeters.
At an altitude of approximately 30 meters prior to landing, the crewmen observed dust
moving away from the center of the descent propulsion blast. The lunar module footpads
penetrated to a maximum depth of 7 or 8 centimeters. The crewmen's boots left prints
generally from 3 millimeters to 2 or 3 centimeters deep (fig. 11-3). Surface material
was easily dislodged when kicked. The
flagpole and drive tubes were pressed into
the surface to a depth of approximately
12 centimeters. At that depth, the regolith
was not sufficiently strong to hold the core
tubes upright. A hammer was used to drive
the core tubes to depths of 15 to 20 centi-
meters. In places, during scooping opera-
tions, rocks were encountered in the
subsurface.
The crewmen's boot treads were sharply
preserved, and angles as large as 70° were
maintained in the footprint walls (fig. 11-4).
The surface disturbed by walking tended to
break into slabs, cracking outward approxi-
mately 12 to 15 centimeters from the edges
of the footprints.
The finest particles of the surface had
some adhesion to boots, gloves, suits, hand-
tools, and rocks on the lunar surface. On
repeated contact, the coating on the boots
thickened to the point that the color of the
boots was completely obscured. When the

During the television pano-
rama, the Commander pointed out
several rocks west of the tele-
vision camera, one of which was
tabular and standing on edge,
protruding 30 centimeters above
the surface. Strewn fields of
angular blocks, many more than
0.5 meter long, occur north and
west of the lunar module. In
general, the rocks tended to be
rounded on top and flat or angu-
lar on the bottom. The cohesive
strength of rock fragments var-
ied, and in some cases the crew
had difficulty in distinguish-
ing aggregates, or clods of fine
debris, from rocks.

Figure 11-4.- Footprint in surface material.
Photographic documentation
of the lunar surface was ac-
quired with a 16-millimeter se-
quence camera, a closeup stereoscopic camera, and two 70-millimeter still cameras (one
with an 80-millimeter lens and the other with a 60-millimeter lens). The camera with
the 60-millimeter lens was intended primarily for gathering geologic data, and a trans-
parent plate containing a five-by-five matrix of crosses was mounted in front of the
film plane to define the coordinate system for the optical geometry.
Photographic procedures planned for the lunar geology experiment for use with the
70-millimeter Hasselblad and the 60-millimeter Tens were the panorama survey, the sample
area survey, and the single sample survey.
The panorama survey consists of 12 pictures taken at intervals of 30° in azimuth and
aimed at the horizon with the lens focused at 22.5 meters. The resulting pictures, when
matched together as a mosaic, form a continuous 360° view of the landing site from which
relative azimuth angles can be measured between features of interest. The Commander took
a partial panorama from the foot of the ladder immediately after he stepped to the lunar
surface (fig. 11-5(a)). Also, three panoramas were taken from the vertexes of an imag-
inary triangle surrounding the lunar module (for example, figs. 11-5(b) and 11-5(c)).
The sample area survey consists of five or more pictures taken of an area 4 to
6 meters from the camera. The first picture was taken approximately down sun, and the
succeeding three or more pictures were taken cross sun, with parallel camera axes at
intervals of 1 to 2 meters.

The single sample survey was designed to record structures that were particularly
significant to the crew. The area was photographed from a distance of 1.6 meters. As
with the sample area survey, the first picture was taken approximately down sun, and the
next two were taken cross sun.
Geologic study from photographs. - The lunar geology experiment includes a detailed
study and comparison of photographs of the rock samples in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory
with photographs taken on the lunar surface. The method of study involves drawings of
geologic sketch maps of faces that show features of the rock unobscured by dust and de-
tailed descriptions of the morphologic (relating to former structure), structural, and
textural features of the rock, together with interpretation of the associated geologic
features. The photographs and geologic sketches constitute a permanent record of the
appearance of the specimens before subsequent destructive laboratory work.
A small rock 2 by 4 by 6 centimeters, which was collected in the contingency sample,
has been tentatively located on the lunar surface photographs. Photographs of the rock
show a fresh-appearing vesicular (with small cavities resulting from vaporization in a
molten mass) lava, similar in vesicularity, texture, and crystallinity to many terres-
trial basalts (fig. 11-2).
The third largest rock in the contingency sample was collected within 2 meters of
the lunar module. The rock has an ovoid shape, tapered at one end, with a broadly
rounded top and nearly flat bottom (fig. 11-6). This rock is approximately 5.5 centi-
meters long, 2 to 3 centimeters wide, and 1.5 to 2 centimeters thick. Parts of the top
and sides of the rock are covered with fine dust, but the bottom and lower sides indicate
a very fine-grained clastic rock containing scattered subrounded rock fragments up to
5 millimeters in diameter. The rounded ovoid shape of the top and sides of this specimen
is irregular in detail. In the central part of the rock, a broad depression is formed by
many coalescing shallow irregular cavities and round pits. Adjacent to the central part,
toward the tapered front end, round deep pits are abundant and so closely spaced that
some pits intersect others and indicate more than one generation of pitting. The bottom
of the rock is marked by two parallel flat surfaces separated by an irregular longitudinal
scarp approximately 0.5 to 1 millimeter high. A few small cavities are present, but no
round pits of the type found on the top appear on the bottom of the rock. An irregular
fracture pattern occurs on the bottom of the rock. The fractures are short, discontinuous,
and largely filled with dust. On the top of the rock near the tapered end, a set of short
fractures 3 to 9 millimeters long is largely dust filled and does not appear to penetrate
far into the rock. On a few sides and corners, there are short curved fractures which
may be exfoliation features. This rock is a breccia of small subangular lithic fragments
in a very fine-grained matrix. The rock resembles the material of the surface layer as
photographed by the stereoscopic closeup camera, except that this specimen is indurated.

Photometric evaluation.- The general photometric characteristics of the surface were
not noticeably different from those observed at the Surveyor landing sites. See "Photog-
raphy" in this section for a more detailed evaluation of the photography during lunar
orbit and surface operations. The albedo of the lunar surface decreased significantly
when the surface was disturbed or covered with a spray of fine-grained material kicked
up by the crew. At low phase angles, the reflectance of the fine-grained material was
increased noticeably, especially where it was compressed smoothly by the crewmen's boots.

Surface traverse and sampling logs. - The television pictures and lunar surface photo-
graphs were used to prepare a map of the locations of surface features, emplaced instru-
ments, and samples (fig. 11-7). The most distant single traverse was made to the
33-meter-diameter crater east of the lunar module.

The contingency sample was taken in view of the sequence camera just outside quad IV
of the lunar module. Two scoopfuls filled the sample bag with approximately 1.03 kilo-
grams of surface material. The areas where the samples were obtained have been accurately
located on a frame (fig. 11-8) of the sequence film taken from the lunar module window.
Both scoopfuls included small rock fragments (figs. 11-9 and 11-10) visible on the sur-
face from the lunar module windows prior to sampling.

The two core-tube samples were taken in
the vicinity of the solar wind composition
experiment. The first core location was doc-
umented by the television camera and by two
individual Hasselblad photographs. The sec-
ond core-tube location, as reported by the
crew, was in the vicinity of the solar wind
composition experiment.
Approximately 20 selected, but unphoto-
graphed, grab samples (approximately 6 kilo-
grams) were collected in the final minutes of
the extravehicular activity. These specimens
were collected in a region 10 to 15 meters
south of the lunar module and near the east
rim of the large double crater.

sample rocks have been located, and the
locations of two rocks have been tentatively

photographs with photographs taken of the specimens at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.
Evidence for the identification and orientation of rock A (fig. 11-9) was obtained from
the presence of a saddle-shaped notch on its exposed side. Rock C (fig. 11-10) was
characterized by the pitlike depression visible on the photographs. Rock B (fig. 11-9)
is approximately 2 centimeters wide and at this time has not been correlated with the
specimens in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. During bulk sampling, rock fragments were
collected primarily on the northeast rim of the large double crater southwest of the
lunar module.
Photographs taken of the documented sample locality (south of the plus Z footpad)
before and after the extravehicular activity were examined for evidence of rocks that
might have been included in the sample. Figures 11-11 and 11-12 illustrate that three
rather large rocks (up to several tens of centimeters) were removed from their respective
positions shown on the photographs taken before the extravehicular activity. A closer
view of these three rocks was obtained during the extravehicular activity (fig. 11-13).

Geologic handtools. - The geologic handtools included the contingency sample container,
a scoop, a hammer, an extension handle, two core tubes, tongs, two large sample bags, a
weighing scale, two sample return containers, and the gnomon. Also included were small
sample bags numbered for use in documentation. All handtools were used except the gnomon.
The crew reported that, in general, the handtools worked well.
The large scoop attached to the extension handle was used primarily during bulk
sampling to collect rocks and fine-grained material. The large scoop was used approxi-
mately 22 times in collecting the bulk sample. As expected from 1/6-g simulations, some
lunar material tended to fall out of the scoop at the end of a scooping motion.
The hammer was used to drive the core tubes, which were attached to the extension
handle. Blows hard enough to dent the top of the extension handle could be struck. The
extension handle was attached to the large scoop for taking bulk samples and was attached
to the core tubes for taking core samples.
Two core tubes were driven, and each collected a satisfactory sample. Each tube had
an internally tapered bit that compressed the sample 2.2:1 inside the tube. One core
tube contained 10 centimeters of sample, and the other contained 13 centimeters of sample.
The tubes were difficult to drive deeper than approximately 20 centimeters. This dif-
ficulty may have been partially caused by the increasing density of the fine-grained
material with depth or by other mechanical characteristics of the lunar regolith. The
difficulty of penetration was also a function of the tapered bit, which caused greater
resistance with increased penetration. One tube was difficult to attach to the extension
handle. When this tube was detached from the extension handle, the butt end of the tube
unscrewed and was lost on the lunar surface. The tubes were opened after the flight, and
the split liners inside both tubes were found to be offset at the bit end. The Teflon

against the inside of the split tube.
The tongs were used to pick up the documented samples and to right the closeup
stereoscopic camera when it fell over on the lunar surface. One of the large sample bags
was used for stowage of documented samples. The other large bag, the weigh bag, was
used for stowage of bulk samples. The weighing scale was used only as a hook to suspend
the bulk sample bag from the lunar module during the collection of bulk samples.
Lunar Soil Mechanics Experiment
The lunar surface at the Apollo 11 landing site was similar in appearance, behavior,
and mechanical properties to the surface observed at the Surveyor maria landing sites.
Although the lunar surface material differs considerably in composition and in range of
particle shapes from a terrestrial soil of the same particle size distribution, it does
not appear to differ significantly in its engineering behavior.
A variety of data was obtained through detailed crew observations, photography,
telemetered dynamic data, and examination of the returned lunar surface material and rock
samples. This information permitted a preliminary assessment of the physical and mechan-
ical properties of the lunar surface materials. Simulations based on current data are
planned to gain further insight into the physical characteristics and mechanical behavior
of lunar surface materials.
Observed characteristics. The physical characteristics of lunar surface materials
were first indicated during the lunar module descent. At that time, the crew noticed a
transparent sheet of dust resembling a thin layer of ground fog that moved radially out-
ward and caused a gradual decrease in visibility.
Inspection of the area below the descent stage after landing revealed no evidence
of an erosion crater and little change in the apparent topography. The surface immedi-
ately underneath the engine skirt had a singed appearance and was slightly etched
(fig. 11-14). The surface appearance indicated that the descent engine had caused a
sculpturing effect that entended outward from the engine. Visible streaks of eroded
material extended to a maximum distance of approximately 1 meter beyond the engine skirt.
During ascent, no visible signs of surface erosion were observed. The insulation
blown off the descent stage generally moved outward on extended flight paths in a manner
similar to that of the eroded surface particles during descent, although the crew re-
ported that the insulation was, in some cases, blown for several miles.
The landing gear footpads penetrated the lunar surface 2 to 8 centimeters, and there
was no discernible throwout from the footpads. Figures 11-15 to 11-18 show the footpads
of the plus Y, minus Z, and minus Y struts. The same photographs show the postlanding
condition of the lunar contact probes, which had dug into and were dragged through the
lunar surface, as well as some surface bulldozing caused by the minus Z footpad in the
direction of the left lateral motion during landing. The bearing pressure on each
footpad was 1 or 2 psi.
The upper centimeters of lunar surface material in the vicinity of the landing site
are characterized by a brownish, medium-gray, slightly cohesive granular material that
is largely composed of bulky grains in the size range of silt to fine sand. Angular to
subrounded rock fragments up to 1 meter in diameter are distributed throughout the area.
Some of these fragments were observed to lie on the surface, some were partially buried,
and others were barely exposed.

The lunar surface is relatively soft to
depths of 5 to 20 centimeters. The surface
can be easily scooped, offers low resistance
to penetration, and provides slight lateral
support for staffs, poles, and core tubes.
Beneath this relatively soft surface, re-
sistance to penetration increases consider-
ably. The available data indicate that this
increase is caused by an increase in the
density of material at the surface rather
than by the presence of rock fragments or
bedrock.
Natural clods of fine-grained material
crumbled under the crewmen's boots. The be-
havior of the clods, while not fully under-
stood, indicates cementation or natural
cohesion between the grains (or both). In
nitrogen, returned lunar surface samples were
also found to cohere to some extent after
being separated, although to a lesser degree

vacuum environment.
The lunar surface material was loose, powdery, and fine-grained and exhibited ad-
hesive characteristics. As a result, the material tended to stick to any object with
which it came in contact, including the crewmen's boots and suits, the television cable,
and the lunar equipment conveyor. During operation of the lunar equipment conveyor, the
powder adhering to it was carried into the spacecraft cabin. Also, sufficient fine-
grained material collected on the equipment conveyor to cause binding.
The thin layer of material adhering to the crewmen's boot soles caused a tendency
to slip on the ladder during ingress. Similarly, the powdery coating of the rocks on the
lunar surface caused some slipping. (See section 4.) A fine dust confined between two
relatively hard surfaces, such as a boot sole and a ladder rung or a rock surface, would
be expected to produce a tendency to slip. However, the lunar surface provided adequate
bearing strength for standing, walking, loping, or jumping and sufficient traction for
starting, turning, or stopping.
Small, fresh crater walls having slope angles of up to 15° could be readily nego-
tiated by the crew. Going straight down or up was found to be preferable to traversing
these slopes sideways. The footing was not secure because the varying thicknesses of
unstable layer material tended to slide in an unpredictable fashion.
The material on the rims and walls of larger size craters, with wall slopes ranging
up to 35°, appeared to be more compact and stable than that on the smaller craters.
Examination of lunar material samples. Preliminary observations were made of the
general appearance, structure, texture, color, grain-size distribution, consistency,
compactness, and mechanical behavior of the fine-grained material sampled by the core
tubes and collected during the contingency, bulk, and documented samplings. These in-
vestigations are reported in greater detail in other reports.

Examination of Lunar Samples
A total of 22 kilograms of lunar material was returned by the Apollo 11 crew;
11 kilograms were rock fragments more than 1 centimeter in diameter, and 11 kilograms
were smaller particulate material. Because the crewman filled the documented sample
container by picking up selected rocks with tongs, the container held a variety of large
rocks (total weight, 6.0 kilograms). The total bulk sample weighed 14.6 kilograms.
The returned lunar material may be divided into the following four groups:
1. Type A: fine-grained crystalline igneous rock containing vesicles (cavities)
2. Type B: medium-grained vuggy (small cavity) crystalline igneous rock
3. Type C: breccia (rock consisting of sharp fragments imbedded in a fine-grained
matrix) made of small fragments of gray rocks and fine material
4. Type D: fines (mixtures of very small particles of various sizes)
The major findings of a preliminary examination of the lunar samples are as follows:
1. Based on the fabric and mineralogy, the rocks can be divided into two groups:
(a) fine- and medium-grained crystalline rocks of igneous origin, probably originally
deposited as lava flows, then dismembered and redeposited as impact debris and (b) brec-
cias of complex history.
2. The crystalline rocks are different from any terrestrial rock and from mete-
orites, as shown by the bulk chemistry studies and by analyses of mineral concentration
in a specified area.
3. Erosion has occurred on the lunar surface, as indicated by the rounding on most
rocks and by the evidence of exposure to a process which gives the rocks a surface ap-
pearance similar to sandblasted rocks. No evidence exists of erosion by surface water.
4. The probable presence of the assemblage iron-troilite-ilmenite and the absence
of any hydrated phase suggest that the crystalline rocks were formed under extremely low
partial pressures of oxygen, water, and sulfur (in the range of those in equilibrium
with most meteorites).
5. The absence of secondary hydrated minerals suggests that there has been no sur-
face water at Tranquility Base at any time since the rocks were exposed.
6. Evidence of shock or impact metamorphism is common in the rocks and fines.
7. All the rocks display glass-lined surface pits which may have been caused by
the impact of small particles.
8. The fine material and the breccia contain large amounts of all noble gases with
elemental and isotopic abundances that almost certainly were derived from the solar wind.
The fact that interior samples of the breccias contain these gases implies that the
wind. breccias were formed at the lunar surface from material previously exposed to the solar
9. The 40K/40 Ar measurements on igneous rock indicate that those rocks crystal-
lized 3 to 4 billion years ago. Cosmic-ray-produced nuclides indicate that the rocks
have been within 1 meter of the surface for periods of 20 to 160 million years.
147

--- PAGE 160 ---
10. The level of indigenous volatilizable or pyrolyzable (or both) organic material
appears to be extremely low (considerably less than 1 ppm).
11. The chemical analyses of 23 lunar samples show that all rocks and fines are
generally similar chemically.
12. The elemental constituents of lunar samples are the same as those found in
terrestrial igneous rocks and meteorites. However, several significant differences in
composition occur: (a) Some refractory elements (such as titanium and zirconium) are
notably enriched, and (b) the alkalis and some volatile elements are depleted.
13. Elements that are enriched in iron meteorites (that is, nickel, cobalt, and
the platinum group) either were not observed or were low in abundance.
14. The chemical analysis of the fine material is in excellent agreement with the
results of the alpha-backscattering measurement at the Surveyor V site.
15. Of 12 radioactive species identified, two were cosmogenic radionuclides of
short half life (⁵²Mn which has a half life of 5.7 days and 48v which has a half life
of 16.1 days).
16. Uranium and thorium concentrations were near the typical values for terrestrial
basalts; however, the potassium-to-uranium ratio determined for lunar surface material is
much lower than such values determined for either terrestrial rocks or meteorites.
17. The observed high concentration of 26 A1 is consistent with a long-cosmic-ray
exposure age inferred from the rare-gas analysis.
18. To date, no evidence of biological material has been found in the samples.
19. The lunar surface material at the lunar module landing site is predominantly
fine grained, granular, slightly cohesive, and incompressible. The hardness increases
considerably at a depth of 6 inches. The soil is similar in appearance and behavior to
the soil at the Surveyor landing sites.
Passive Seismic Experiment
The early Apollo scientific experiment package seismometer system met the require-
ments of the experiment for the first 2 weeks of its operation. No significant instru-
mental deficiencies were encountered, despite the fact that maximum operating temperatures
exceeded those planned for the instrument by as much as 50° F.
Analysis of calibration pulses and signals received from various crew activities in-
dicated that all four seismometers were operating properly. Instrument response curves
derived from calibration pulses are shown in figure 11-19.
During the first lunar day, data were acquired at 11:40:39 p.m. e.s.t., July 20,
1969, and transmission was stopped by command from Mission Control Center at 06:58:46 a.m.
e.s.t., August 3, 1969, when the predicted rate of solar panel output power drop occurred
at lunar sunset. This output power drop occurred approximately 4 hours 40 minutes before
the sunset time predicted for a flat surface, indicating an effective slope of 2°20' up-
ward to the west at the deployment site.

54-second oscillation for a 2- to 3-day interval centered near lunar noon when the rate
of change of external temperature with time would be at a minimum. The signals were of
low frequency (with a period of approximately 20 seconds to 2 minutes). It is assumed
that these signals correspond to tilting of the instruments. The tilting is caused by
a combination of thermal distortions of the metal pallet which serves as the instrument

ever, the two peaks at 11.3 and 12.3 hertz would be dominant if the spectrum were cor-

some way to thermal effects. More than 200 of these events were identified.

--- PAGE 164 ---
High-frequency signals from an undetermined source were observed. These signals
began with large amplitudes on the short-period seismometer and gradually decreased over
a period of 8 days until they disappeared completely on July 30, 1969. During the final
stages of this activity, the signals became repetitive, with nearly identical structure
from train to train. As mentioned previously, the predominant frequency of these signals
was approximately 7.2 hertz before the lunar module ascent and 8.0 hertz after the lunar
module ascent. The complete disappearance of these signals and their nearly identical
form have led to the tentative conclusion that they were produced by the lunar module
itself, presumably by venting processes.
Some of the observed high-frequency signals may have been from nearby meteoroid im-
pacts. An analysis is being made of several high-frequency signals which may correspond
to meteoroid impacts at ranges of a few kilometers or less from the passive seismic ex-
periment package. Substantive remarks on these events cannot be made until spectra of
the signals are computed.
Distant seismic events.- During the period July 22 to 24, 1969, three of the re-
corded signals appear to be surface waves, that is, seismic waves which travel along
the surface of the moon in contrast to body waves which would travel through the interior
of the moon. Body waves (compressional and shear waves) produced by a given seismic
source normally travel at higher velocities than surface waves and, hence, are observed
on the record before the surface waves. No body waves were observed for distant seismic
events. The wave trains begin with short-period oscillations (2 to 4 seconds) which
gradually increase in period to 16 to 18 seconds when the train dispersed.
A wave train having similar characteristics has been observed on the long-period
vertical channel in association with a series of discrete pulses on the short-period
vertical channel. In this case, the long-period wave train observed on the record is
simply the summation of transients corresponding to these pulses and, hence, is of in-
strumental origin. A dispersion of this type is commonly observed on earth in various
types of surface waves. The dispersion, or gradual transformation of an initial impulsive
source to an extended oscillatory train of waves, is produced by propagation through a
wave guide of some type. The events observed appear only on the horizontal-component
seismometers. Such horizontally polarized waves, when observed on earth, would be called
Love waves. On earth, surface waves which have a vertical component of motion (Rayleigh
waves) are usually the most prominent waves on a record from a distant event. Several
possibilities are presently under study to explain these waves.
Engineering evaluation.- From acquisition of initial data to turn-off, the passive
seismic experiment package operated for 319 hours 18 minutes. The power and data sub-
systems performed extremely well, particularly in view of the abnormally high operating
temperatures. The output of the solar cell array was within 1 to 2 watts of the expected
value and was always higher than the 27-watt minimum design specification.
Approximately 99.8 percent of the data from the passive seismic experiment package
are preserved on tape. Several occurrences of data dropout were determined to be caused
by a source other than the seismic experiment system. The passive seismic experiment
showed good response in detection of the crewmen's footsteps, the portable life support
system ejection from the lunar module, and the movements by the crew in the lunar module
prior to lift-off.
Data from the dust and thermal radiation engineering measurement were obtained con-
tinuously except for brief turn-off periods associated with power/thermal management.
Nine hundred and sixteen commands were transmitted and accepted by the passive seismic
experiment package. Most of these commands were used to level the equipment, thereby
correcting for the thermal distortions of the supporting primary structure.
152

--- PAGE 165 ---
The down-link signal strength received from the passive seismic experiment package
agrees with the predictions. For the 30-foot antennas, the strength ranged from -135 to
-139 dBm, and for the 85-foot antennas, the strength ranged from -125 to -127 dBm.
Normal operation was initiated on the second lunar day by command from Mission Con-
trol Center at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t., August 19, 1969, approximately 20 hours after sunrise
at Tranquility Base. Transmission stopped at 6:08 a.m. e.s.t., September 1, 1969, with
the loss of solar panel output power at lunar sunset. The loss of transmission was dis-
appointing; however, at the time of the loss, the passive seismic experiment package had
exceeded the design objectives.
Data received, including seismometer measurements, were consistent with those re-
corded at corresponding sun elevation angles on the first lunar day. Operation continued
until the data system did not respond to a transmitted command at 3:50 a.m. e.s.t.,
August 25, 1969 (approximately noon of the second lunar day). No command was accepted
by the passive seismic experiment package after that time, despite repeated attempts
under a wide variety of conditions. The initial impact of the loss of command capability
was the inability to relevel the long-period seismic sensors. As a result, all three
axes became SO unbalanced that the data were meaningless; however, meaningful data con-
tinued to be received from the short-period seismic sensor.
Valid short-period seismic sensor and telemetry data continued to be received and
recorded during the remainder of the second lunar day. Component temperatures and power
levels continued to be nominal and corresponded to values recorded at the same sun angles
on the first lunar day. The passive seismic experiment was automatically switched to the
standby mode of operation when the power dropped at sunset.
Down-link transmission was acquired during the third lunar day at 5:27 p.m. e.s.t.,
September 16, 1969. Transmission stopped at 6:31 a.m. e.s.t., October 1, 1969, with the
loss of power at lunar sunset. Efforts to restore command communications were unsuccess-
ful. The passive seismic experiment remained in the standby mode of operation, with no
seismic data output. Data from the dust and thermal radiation engineering measurement
went off scale low at 10:00 p.m. e.s.t., September 16, 1969, and remained off scale
throughout the day. The down-link signal strength, component temperatures, and power
levels continued to be nominal and corresponded to values recorded at the same sun angles
on previous days.
Engineering conclusions.- Tentative conclusions based on a preliminary analysis of
data obtained during the first recording period (July 21 to August 3) are as follows:
1. The seismic background signal on the moon is less than the threshold sensitivity
of the instrument (0.3 millimicron). Seismometers are able to operate on the lunar sur-
face at 10 to 100 times higher sensitivity than is possible on earth.
2. Allowing for the difference in size between the earth and the moon, the occur-
rence of seismic events (moonquakes or impacts) on the moon is much less frequent than
the occurrence of earthquakes on the earth.
3. Despite the puzzling features of the possible surface wave trains, an attempt is
being made to find lunar models compatible with the data.
4. Erosional processes corresponding to landslides along crater walls may be oper-
ative within one or more relatively young craters located within a few kilometers of the
passive seismic experiment package.

Laser Ranging Retroreflector Experiment
The laser ranging retroreflector was deployed approximately 14 meters south-southwest
of the lunar module in a relatively smooth area (fig. 11-26). The bubble was not pre-
cisely in the center of the leveling device, but was between the center and the innermost
division in the southwest direction. This misalinement indicated an off-level condition
of less than 30 minutes of arc. The shadow lines and sun compass markings were clearly
visible, and the crew reported that these devices showed that the alinement was precise.
On August 1, 1969, the Lick Observatory obtained reflected signals from the laser
ranging retroreflector. The signal continued to appear for the remainder of the night.
Between 5 and 8 J/pulse were transmitted at 6943 angstroms. When the 120-inch telescope
was used, each returned signal contained, on the average, more than one photoelectron,
a value that indicated that the condition of the retroreflector on the surface was
entirely satisfactory.
On August 20, 1969, the McDonald Observatory obtained reflected signals from the
retroreflector. The round-trip signal time was found to be 2.49596311 (±0.00000003) sec-
onds, an uncertainty equivalent to a distance variation of 4.5 meters.
The Lick Observatory and McDonald Observ-
atory observations, made a few days before
lunar sunset and a few days after lunar sun-
rise, show that the thermal design of the
retroreflector permits operation during sun-
illuminated periods and that the retroreflec-
tor survived the lunar night satisfactorily.
The observations also indicate that no serious
degradation of optical performance occurred
as a result of flaked insulation, debris,
dust, or rocket exhaust products which scat-
tered during the lunar module lift-off.
The scientific objectives of the laser
ranging retroreflector experiment - studies
of gravitation, relativity, and earth and
lunar physics - can be achieved only by suc-
cessfully monitoring the changes in the dis-
tances from stations on earth to the laser
beam reflector on the moon with an uncertainty
of approximately 15 centimeters over a period
of many years. The McDonald Observatory is
being instrumented to make daily observations
with this accuracy, and it is expected that
several other stations capable of this rang-

Solar Wind Composition Experiment
The solar wind composition experiment was designed to measure the abundance and the
isotopic compositions of the noble gases in the solar wind (³He, 4He, 20Ne, 21 Ne, ²²Ne,
36 Ar, and 38 Ar). The experiment consisted of a specially prepared aluminum foil with an
effective area of 0.4 square meter (fig. 11-27). The experiment was deployed approxi-
mately 6 meters from the lunar module. The staff of the experiment penetrated 13.5 cent-
imeters into the surface.
154

--- PAGE 167 ---
When exposed to the solar wind at the
lunar surface, solar wind particles which ar-
rived with velocities of a few hundred kilo-
meters per second penetrated the foil to a
depth of several millionths of a centimeter
and became firmly trapped. The foil was re-
trieved after a 77-minute exposure to the
lunar environment. The return unit was placed
into a special Teflon bag and returned to
earth in the lunar sample return container.
A portion of the foil was cut out, placed in-
to a metal gasket vacuum container, and heat
sterilized at 125° C for 39 hours. The evolv-
ing atoms were then analyzed in statically
operated mass spectrometers, and the absolute
and isotopic quantities of the particles were
determined.
Photography
During the mission, all nine of the
70-millimeter and all 13 of the 16-millimeter
film magazines carried on board the spacecraft
were exposed. Approximately 90 percent of the
photographic objectives were accomplished, in-
cluding approximately 85 percent of the re-
quested lunar photography and approximately
46 percent of the target-of-opportunity
photography.
Photographic objectives. - The lunar sur-
face photographic objectives were as follows:
1. Long-distance coverage from the com-
mand module
Figure 11-27.- Solar wind composition
2. Lunar mapping photography from orbit
experiment deployed.
3. Photography of the landed lunar
module location
4. Sequence photography during descent, lunar stay, and ascent
5. Still photographs through the lunar module window
6. Still photographs on the lunar surface
7. Closeup stereoscopic photography
Film description and processing.- Special care was taken in the selection, prepara-
tion, calibration, and processing of the film to maximize returned information. The
types of film included and exposed are listed in table 11-II.

Photographic results.- Lunar photography from the command module consisted mainly
of photographs of specified targets of opportunity, together with a short strip of ver-
tical still photography from approximately 170° to 120° E longitude. Most of the other
70-millimeter command module photography was of the lunar surface features selected by
the crew.
The 16-millimeter sequence camera photography was generally excellent. The descent
film was used to determine the location of the landed lunar module. One sequence of
16-millimeter coverage taken from the lunar module window shows the lunar surface change
from a light to a dark color wherever the crew walked.
The quantity and quality of still photographs taken through the lunar module window
and on the lunar surface were very good. On some sequences, to ensure good photography,
the crew varied the exposures one stop in either direction from the exposure indicated.
The still photography on the surface indicates that the landing-site location determined
by use of the 16-millimeter descent film is correct.
The closeup stereoscopic photography provides good-quality imagery of 17 areas,
each 3 by 3 inches. These areas included various rocks, some ground surface cracks, and
rocks which appear to have been partially melted or splattered with molten glass.
Photographic lighting and color effects.- When the lunar surface was viewed from the
command module window, the color was reported to vary with the viewing angle. A high sun
angle caused the surface to appear brown, and a low sun angle caused the surface to ap-
pear slate gray. From the command module, distinct color variations were seen in the
maria, and these variations are very pronounced on the processed film. According to the
crew, the 16-millimeter photographs are more representative of the true surface color
than are the 70-millimeter photographs. However, prints from both film types have shown
tints of green and other shades which are not realistic. Underexposure contributes to
the green tint, and the printing process can increase this effect. Each generation away
from the original copy will cause a further increase in this tinting. On the original
film, the greenish tint in the dark, or underexposed, areas is a function of spacecraft
156

--- PAGE 169 ---
window transmission characteristics and low sun angles. For Apollo 12, the master film
copies will be color corrected, which should greatly minimize unrealistic tinting.
A 16-millimeter film sequence from the lunar module window shows crew activities in
both gray and light-brown areas. As the crewmen moved, the gray area, which is apparently
softer, deeper material, turned almost black. The crewmen's feet visibly sank in this

The color pictures in which the fine-grained parts of the lunar surface appear gray
are properly exposed, while those pictures in which the lunar surface is light brown to
light tan are generally overexposed. The rocks appear light gray to brownish gray in
pictures that are properly exposed for the rocks and vary from light tan to an off white
where overexposed. The crew reported that fine-grained lunar material and rocks appeared
to be gray to dark gray. These materials appeared slightly brownish gray when observed
near a zero phase angle. Small brownish, tan, and golden reflections were observed on
rock surfaces.
The targets and associated exposure values for each frame of the lunar surface film
magazines were carefully planned before flight. Nearly all of the photographs were taken
at the recommended exposure settings.
Preflight simulations and training photography indicated that at shutter speeds of
1/125 second or longer, a suited crewman could induce excessive image motion during ex-
posure. A shutter speed of 1/250 second was therefore chosen to reduce the unwanted
motion to an acceptable level. Corresponding f-stops were then determined which would
provide correct exposure under predicted lunar lighting conditions. At the completion
of the training program, the crew was proficient at photographing different subjects
under varying lighting conditions.
To simplify camera operations, f-stops of 5.6 and 11 were chosen for exposures in
the cross-sun and down-sun directions, respectively. This exposure information was pro-
vided on decals attached to the film magazines and was used successfully.
The crewmen chose exposures for unusual lighting conditions. For example, the
photographs of the Lunar Module Pilot descending the ladder were taken at an f-stop of
5.6 and a speed of 1/60 second, and the best photograph of the landing-leg plaque was
taken at an exposure of 5.6 and a speed of 1/30 second. When a high depth of field was
required, exposures were made with smaller apertures and correspondingly slower shutter
speeds to maintain equivalent exposure values. The crewmen usually steadied the camera
exposures. against the remote-control-unit brackets on their suits during these slower speed
A preliminary analysis of all lunar surface exposures indicates that the nominal
shutter speed of 1/250 second appears to be a good compromise between depth of field and
crew-induced image motion. In those specific instances where a slower shutter speed was
required, either because of depth-of-field or lighting considerations, the crew was able
to minimize image motion by steadying the camera. However, the selection of the
1/250-second speed will be reevaluated for continued general photography. Figures 11-3,
11-4, and 11-18 are representative of lunar surface photography.

12. BIOMEDICAL EVALUATION
This section is a summary of the Apollo 11 quarantine procedures and medical find-
ings, based upon a preliminary analysis of biomedical data. More comprehensive evalua-
tions will be published in separate medical reports.
The three crewmen accumulated 585 man-hours of space flight experience during the
lunar landing mission, including 2 hours 14 minutes and 1 hour 42 minutes on the lunar
surface for the Commander and the Lunar Module Pilot, respectively.
The crew's health and performance were excellent throughout the flight and the
18-day postflight quarantine period. No significant physiological changes were observed
after this mission, as has been the case on all previous missions, and no effects attrib-
utable to lunar surface exposure have been observed.
Bioinstrumentation and Physiological Data
The biomedical data were of very good quality. Only two minor problems occurred,
both late in the flight. Data from the Command Module Pilot's impedance pneumogram
became unreadable, and the Lunar Module Pilot's electrocardiogram signal degraded because
of drying of the electrode paste under the sensors. The Lunar Module Pilot replaced the
electrocardiogram leads in his bioinstrumentation harness with the spare set from the
medical kit, and proper readings were restored. No attempt was made to correct the Com-
mand Module Pilot's respiration signal, because of entry preparations. Physiological
parameters were always within expected ranges, and sleep data were obtained on all three
crewmen during most of the mission.
The average heart rates during the entire mission were 71, 60, and 67 beats/min for
the Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot, respectively. During the
mander's heart rates, which ranged from 100 to 150 beats/min during descent and from
powered descent and ascent phases, the only data planned to be available were the Com-
68 to 120 beats/min during ascent, as shown in figures 12-1 and 12-2, respectively.

Plots of heart rates during lunar surface exploration are shown in figure 12-3. The
average heart rates were 110 beats/min for the Commander and 88 beats/min for the Lunar
Module Pilot. The increase in the Commander's heart rate during the last phases of this
activity is indicative of an increased workload and body heat storage. The metabolic
production of each crewman during the extravehicular activity is reported in "Extrave-
hicular Activity" in this section.

Medical Observations
Adaptation to weightlessness. The Commander reported that he felt less zero-g
effects, such as fullness of the head, than he had experienced on his previous flight.
All three crewmen commented that the lack of a gravitational pull caused a puffiness
underneath their eyes, and this condition caused them to squint somewhat. However, none
felt ill effects associated with this puffiness. In donning and doffing the suits, the
crewmen had no feeling of tumbling or the disorientation which has been described by the
Apollo 9 crew.
During the first 2 days of the flight, the Command Module Pilot reported that half
a meal was more than enough to satisfy his hunger, but his appetite subsequently returned.
Medications.- The Commander and the Lunar Module Pilot each took one Lomotil tablet
prior to the sleep period to retard bowel movements before the lunar module activity.
The Commander and Lunar Module Pilot each carried extra Lomotil tablets into the lunar
module, but did not take them. At 4 hours before entry and again after splashdown, the
three crewmen each took antinausea tablets containing 0.3 milligram of Hyoscine and
5.0 milligrams of Dexedrine. The crewmen also took aspirin tablets, but the number of
tablets per individual was not recorded. The Lunar Module Pilot recalled that he had
taken two aspirin tablets almost every night to aid his sleep.
Sleep.- It is interesting to note that the crewmen's subjective estimates of amount
of sleep were less than those based upon telemetered biomedical data, as shown in
table 12-I. By either count, the crewmen slept well in the command module. The simultan-
eous sleep periods during the translunar coast were carefully monitored, and the crew
arrived on the lunar surface well rested. Therefore, it was not necessary to wait until
after the first planned 4-hour sleep period before conducting the extravehicular activity.
160

--- PAGE 173 ---
The crewmen did not sleep well in the lunar module following the lunar surface activity.
(See "Lunar Surface Operations" in section 4.) However, the crewmen slept well during
all three transearth sleep periods.

Radiation.- - The personal radiation dosimeters were read at approximately 12-hour
intervals, as planned. The total integrated, but uncorrected, doses were 0.25, 0.26,
and 0.28 rad for the Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot, respec-
tively. The Van Allen belt dosimeter indicated total integrated doses of 0.11 rad for
the skin reading and 0.08 rad for the depth reading during the entire mission. Thus,
the total dose for each crewman is estimated to have been less than 0.2 rad, which is
well below the medically significant level. Results of the radiochemical assays of feces
and urine and an analysis of the onboard nuclear emulsion dosimeters will be presented in
a separate medical report.
The crewmen were examined with a total body gamma-radioactivity counter on August 10,
1969, after release from quarantine. No induced radioactivity was detected, based on
critical measurements and an integration of the total-body gamma spectrum. The examina-
tion for natural radioactivity revealed the levels of potassium-40 and cesium-137 to be
within the normal range.
Inflight exercise.- The planned exercise program included isometric and isotonic
exercises and the use of an exerciser. As in previous Apollo missions, a calibrated
exercise program was not planned. The inflight exerciser was used primarily for crew
relaxation. During transearth coast, the Lunar Module Pilot exercised vigorously for two
10-minute periods. His heart rate reached 170 and 177 beats/min, and the partial pres-
sure of carbon dioxide increased approximately 0.6 mm Hg during these periods. The heart
rates and the carbon dioxide readings rapidly returned to normal levels when exercise
ceased.
Drug packaging. Several problems concerning drug packaging developed during the
flight. All the medications in tablet and capsule form were packaged in individually
sealed plastic or foil containers. When the medical kit was unstowed in the command mod-
ule, the packages were blown up like balloons because the air had not been sufficiently
161

--- PAGE 174 ---
evacuated during packaging. This ballooning increased the volume of the medical-kit con-
tents after the kit was opened and thus prevented restowage until a flap was cut away
from the kit. Venting of each of the plastic or foil containers will be accomplished for
future flights and should prevent this problem from recurring. The Afrin nasal spray bub-
bled out when the cap was removed and was therefore unusable. The use of cotton in the
spray bottle is expected to resolve this problem on future flights.
Water.- The eight inflight chlorinations of the command module water system were
accomplished normally and essentially as scheduled. Analysis of the potable water sam-
ples obtained approximately 30 hours after the last inflight chlorination showed a free-
chlorine residual of 0.8 milligram from the drinking dispenser port and 0.05 milligram
from the hot-water port. The iodine level in the lunar module tanks, based on preflight
sampling, was adequate for bacterial protection throughout the flight.
Chemical and microbiological analyses of the preflight water samples for both space-
craft showed no significant contaminants. Tests for coliform and anaerobic bacteria, as
well as for yeasts and molds, were negative during the postflight water analysis, which
was delayed because of quarantine restrictions.
A new gas/water separator was used with satisfactory results. The palatability of
the drinking water was greatly improved over that of previous flights because of the
absence of gas bubbles, which can cause gastrointestinal discomfort.
Food.- The food supply for the command module included rehydratable foods and bev-
erages, wet-packed foods, foods contained in spoon-bowl packages, dried fruit, and bread.
The new food items for this mission were candy sticks and jellied fruit candy; ham,
chicken, and tuna salad spreads packaged in lightweight aluminum, easy-open cans; and
cheddar cheese spread and frankfurters packaged in flexible foil as wet-packed foods.
A new pantry-type food system allowed real-time selection of food items based upon indi-
vidual preference and appetite. Four meal periods on the lunar surface were scheduled,
and extra optional items were included with the normal meal packages.
Prior to flight, each crewman evaluated the available food items and selected his
flight menus. The menus provided approximately 2300 kilocalories per man per day and
included 1 gram of calcium, 0.5 gram of phosphorus, and 80 grams of protein. The crew-
men were well satisfied with the quality and variety of the flight foods. They reported
that their food intake met their appetite and energy requirements.
The preparation and eating of sandwiches presented no problems. The only criticisms
of the food system were that the coffee was not particularly good and that the fruit-
flavored beverages tasted too sweet. The new gas/water separator was effective in reduc-
ing the amount of gas in the water and greatly improved the taste of the rehydratable
foods.
Extravehicular Activity
The integrated rates of Btu production and the accumulated Btu production during the
intervals of planned activities are listed in table 12-II. The actual average metabolic
production per hour was estimated to be 900 Btu for the Commander and 1200 Btu for the
Lunar Module Pilot. These values are less than the preflight estimates of 1350 and
1275 Btu for the respective crewmen.

Physical Examinations
Comprehensive medical evaluations were conducted on each crewman at 29, 15, and
5 days prior to the day of launch. Brief physical examinations were then conducted each
day until launch.
The postflight medical evaluation included the following: microbiology studies,
blood studies, physical examinations, orthostatic tolerance tests, exercise response
tests, and chest X-rays.
The recovery-day examination revealed that all three crewmen were in good health
and appeared to be well rested. They showed no fever and had lost no more than the
expected amount of body weight. Each crewman had taken antimotion sickness medication
4 hours prior to entry and again after landing, and no seasickness or adverse symptoms
were experienced.
Data from chest X-rays and electrocardiograms were within normal limits. The only
positive findings were small papules beneath the axillary sensors on both the Commander
and the Lunar Module Pilot. The Commander had a mild serous otitis media of the right
ear, but could clear his ears without difficulty. No treatment was necessary.
The orthostatic tolerance test showed significant increases in the immediate post-
flight heart-rate responses, but these increases were less than the changes seen in pre-
vious Apollo crewmembers. In spite of this apparent improvement, the return to preflight
values was slower than had been observed for previous Apollo crewmembers. The reasons
for this slower recovery are not clear at this time, but in general, these crewmembers
exhibited less decrement in oxygen consumption and work performed than was observed in
exercise response tests after previous Apollo flights.
Followup evaluations were conducted daily during the quarantine period in the Lunar
Receiving Laboratory, and the immunohematology and microbiology analyses revealed no
changes attributable to exposure to the lunar surface material.
Lunar Contamination and Quarantine
The two fundamental responsibilities of the lunar sample program were to preserve
the integrity of the returned lunar samples in the original or near-original state and
to make practical provisions to protect the earth from possible contamination by lunar
substances that might be infectious, toxic, or otherwise harmful to man, animals, or
plants.
The Public Laws and Federal Regulations concerning contamination control for lunar-
sample-return missions are described in reference 7. An interagency agreement between
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Department of Agriculture; the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; the Department of the Interior; and the
National Academy of Sciences (ref. 8) confirmed the existing arrangements for the pro-
tection of the earth and defined the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination. The
quarantine schemes for manned lunar missions were established by the Interagency Com-
mittee on Back Contamination (ref. 9).
The planned 21-day crew quarantine represented the period required in order to pre-
clude the development of infectious disease conditions that could generate volatile epi-
demic events. In addition, early signs of latent infectious diseases with longer
incubation periods would probably be detected through extensive medical and clinical
pathological examinations. However, to provide additional assurance that no infectious
164

--- PAGE 177 ---
disease of lunar origin is present in the Apollo 11 crewmembers, an extensive epidemio-
logical program will continue for 1 year after their release from quarantine.
Lunar exposure.- Although each crewman attempted to clean himself and the equipment
before ingress, a fairly large amount of dust and grains of lunar surface material was
brought into the cabin. When the crewmen removed their helmets, they noticed a distinct,
pungent odor emanating from the lunar material. The texture of the dust was like pow-
dered graphite, and both crewmen were very dirty after they removed their helmets, over-
shoes, and gloves. The crewmen cleaned their hands and faces with tissues and with
towels that had been soaked in hot water. The Commander removed his liquid cooling gar-
ment in order to clean his body. One grain of material got into the Commander's eye,
but was easily removed and caused no problem. The dustlike material could not be removed
completely from beneath the crewmen's fingernails.
The cabin cleaning procedure involved the use of a vacuum-brush device and positive
air pressure from the suit supply hoses to blow remote particles into the atmosphere for
collection in the lithium hydroxide filters in the environmental control system.
The concern that particles remaining in the lunar module would float in the cabin
atmosphere at zero-g after ascent caused the crew to remain helmeted to prevent contami-
nation of the eyes and respiratory system. However, floating particles were not a prob-
lem. The cabin and equipment were further cleaned with the vacuum brush. The equipment
from the surface and the pressure garment assemblies were placed in bags for transfer to
the command module. Before transfer to the command module, the spacecraft systems were
configured to cause a positive gas flow from the command module through the hatch dump/
relief valve in the lunar module.
During the return to earth, the interior of the command module was cleaned at 24-hour
intervals by using the vacuum brush and towels. In addition, the circulation of the cabin
atmosphere through the lithium hydroxide filters continued to remove traces of particu-
late material.
Recovery procedures.- The recovery procedures were successfully conducted with no
compromises of the planned quarantine techniques. The times of the major postlanding
events are listed in "Recovery Operations" in section 13.
After the command module was uprighted, four biological isolation garments and the
decontamination gear were lowered to one of two liferafts. One of the four swimmers
donned a biological isolation garment. The second liferaft was then moved to the space-
craft. The protected swimmer retired with the second liferaft to the original upwind
position. The hatch was opened, the crew's biological isolation garments were inserted
into the command module, and the hatch was closed.
After donning the biological isolation garments, the crew egressed. The protected
swimmer sprayed the upper deck and hatch areas with Betadine, a water-soluble iodine
solution, as planned in the quarantine procedure. After the four men and the liferaft
were wiped with a solution of sodium hypochlorite, the three swimmers returned to the
vicinity of the spacecraft to stand by during the helicopter pickup of the flightcrew.
The crewmen were brought up into the helicopter without incident and remained in
the aft compartment. As expected, a moderate amount of water was present on the floor
after retrieval, and the water was wiped up with towels. The helicopter crewmen were
also protected from possible contamination.
The helicopter was moved to the Mobile Quarantine Facility on the lower deck of the
recovery vessel. The crewmen walked across the deck, entered the Mobile Quarantine Facil-
ity, and removed their biological isolation garments. The descent steps and the deck
165

--- PAGE 178 ---
area between the helicopter and the Mobile Quarantine Facility were sprayed with glutaral-
dehyde solution, which was mopped up after a 30-minute contact time.
After the crewmen had been picked up, the protected swimmer scrubbed the upper deck
around the postlanding vents, the hatch area, and the flotation collar near the hatch
with Betadine. The remaining Betadine was emptied into the bottom of the recovery raft.
The swimmer removed his biological isolation garment and placed it in the Betadine in
the liferaft. The disinfectant sprayers were dismantled and sunk. After a 30-minute
contact time, the liferaft and remaining equipment were sunk.
Following egress of the flightcrew and a recovery surgeon from the helicopter, the
hatch of the helicopter was closed and the vehicle was towed to the flight deck for
decontamination with formaldehyde.
The crew became uncomfortably warm while they were enclosed in the biological isola-
tion garments in the environment (90° F) of the helicopter cabin. On two of the garments,
the visor fogged up because of the improper fit of the nose and mouth cup. To alleviate
this discomfort on future missions, consideration is being given to (1) replacing the
present biological isolation garment with a lightweight coverall, similar to whiteroom
clothing, with respirator mask, cap, gloves, and booties and (2) using a liquid cooling
garment under the biological isolation garment.
The command module was taken aboard the U.S.S. Hornet approximately 3 hours after
landing and was attached to the Mobile Quarantine Facility through a flexible tunnel.
The removal of lunar surface samples, film, data tape, and medical samples went well,
with one exception. Two of the medical sample containers leaked within the inner biologi-
cal isolation container. Corrective measures were promptly executed, and the quarantine
procedure was not violated.
Transfer of the Mobile Quarantine Facility from the recovery ship to a C-141 air-
craft and from the aircraft to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the NASA Manned Space-
craft Center was accomplished without any question of a quarantine violation. The
transfer of the lunar surface samples and the command module into the Lunar Receiving
Laboratory was also accomplished as planned.
Quarantine.- A total of 20 persons on the medical support teams were exposed,
directly or indirectly, to lunar material for periods ranging from 5 to 18 days. Daily
medical observations and periodic laboratory examinations showed no signs or symptoms of
infectious disease related to lunar exposure.
No microbial growth was observed from the prime lunar samples after 156 hours of
incubation on all types of differential media. No micro-organisms which could be attrib-
uted to an extraterrestrial source were recovered from the crewmen or the spacecraft.
None of the 24 mice injected intraperitoneally with lunar material showed visible
shock reaction following injection, and all remained alive and healthy during the first
10 days of a 50-day toxicity test. During the first 7 days of testing of the prime lunar
samples in germ-free mice, all findings were consistent with the decision to release the
crew from quarantine.
Samples from the crewmen were injected into tissue cultures, suckling mice, myco-
plasma media, and 6- and 10-day-old embryonated eggs. There was no evidence of viral
replication in any of the host systems at the end of 2 weeks. During the first 8 days
of testing the lunar material, all findings were compatible with crew release from
quarantine.

No significant trends were noted in any biochemical, immunological, or hematological
parameters in either the flightcrew or the medical support personnel.
The personnel in quarantine and in the Crew Reception Area of the Lunar Receiving
Laboratory were approved for release from quarantine on August 10, 1969. Following decon-
tamination with formaldehyde, the interior of the command module and the ground servicing
equipment utilized in the decontamination procedures were approved for release from quar-
antine on August 10, 1969. The samples of lunar material and other items stored in the
biological isolation containers in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory were released to prin-
cipal scientific investigators in September 1969.

13. MISSION SUPPORT PERFORMANCE
Flight Control
Preflight simulations provided adequate flight control training for all mission
phases. Also, the flight controllers on the descent team supplemented this training by
conducting descent simulations with the Apollo 12 crew. Interfaces between Mission
Control teammembers and the flightcrew were effective, and no major operational problems
were encountered. The two-way flow of information between the flightcrew and the flight
controllers was effective. The overloading of the lunar module guidance computer during
powered descent was assessed accurately, and the information provided to the flightcrew
permitted continuation of descent.
The flight control response to those problems identified during the mission was
based on real-time data. Sections 8, 9, and 16 should be consulted for the postflight
analyses of these problems. Three of the more pertinent real-time decisions are dis-
cussed in the following paragraphs.
At acquisition of signal after lunar orbit insertion, data showed that the indicated
tank B nitrogen pressure was approximately 300 psi lower than expected and that the
pressure had started to decrease at 80 seconds into the maneuver. (See "Service Pro-
pulsion Nitrogen Leak" in section 16.) To conserve nitrogen and to maximize system
reliability for transearth injection, it was recommended that the circularization
maneuver be performed, using tank A only. No further leak was apparent, and both tanks
were used normally for transearth injection.
Five computer program alarms occurred between 5 and 10 minutes after initiation of
powered descent. These alarms are symptoms of possible computer overloading. However,
it had been decided before flight that bailout-type alarms such as these would not
prevent continuation of the flight, even though the alarms could cause violations of
other mission rules, such as velocity differences. The alarms did not occur continually,
and proper computer navigation functions were being performed; therefore, a decision
was given to continue the descent.
During the crew rest period on the lunar surface, two checklist changes were recom-
mended, based on the events of the previous 20 hours: (1) the rendezvous radar would
remain off during the ascent firing and (2) the MODE-SELECT switch would not be placed
in the PRIMARY GUIDANCE position, thus preventing the computer from generating altitude
and altitude rate for the telemetry display. The reason for these changes was to prevent
computer overload during ascent, as had occurred during descent.
Manned Space Flight Network Performance
The Mission Control Center and the Manned Space Flight Network were placed on mission
status on July 7, 1969, and supported the lunar landing mission satisfactorily. Hardware,
communications, and computer support in the Mission Control Center was excellent. No
major data losses were attributed to these systems, and the few failures that did occur
had minimal impact on support operations. Air-to-ground communications were generally
good during the mission; however, a number of significant problems were experienced as a
result of procedural errors.
The support provided by the real-time computer complex was generally excellent, and
only one major problem was experienced. During translunar coast, a problem in updating
digital-to-television displays by the use of the primary computer resulted in the loss of
all real-time television displays for approximately an hour. The problem was isolated to
the interface between the computer and the display equipment.

Operations by the communications processors were excellent, and the few problems that
did occur caused only minor losses of mission data.
Air-to-ground voice communications were generally good, although a number of ground
problems caused temporary loss or degradation of communications. Shortly after landing
on the lunar surface, the crew complained about the noise level on the S-band voice up
linked from the Goldstone station. This problem occurred while the Goldstone station was
configured in the Manned Space Flight Network relay mode. The source of the noise was
isolated to a breaking of squelch control caused by high noise on the command module down
link being subsequently up linked to the lunar module by way of the relay mode. The
noise was eliminated by disabling the relay mode. On several occasions during the mis-
sion, spacecraft voice on the Goddard conference loop was degraded by the voice-operated
gain-adjust amplifiers. In most cases, the problem was cleared by disabling the ampli-
fier unit at the remote site.
Command operations were good throughout the mission. Of the approximately 3450 exe-
cution commands transmitted during the mission, only 24 were rejected by remote-site
command computers, and 21 were lost for unknown reasons. Approximately 450 command loads
were generated and successfully transferred to the Manned Space Flight Network stations,
and 58 of these were up linked to the spacecraft.
Both C- and S-band tracking support were good. Loss of tracking coverage was
experienced during translunar injection when the U.S.N.S. Mercury was unable to provide
high-speed trajectory data because of a temporary problem in the central data processor.
Some stations also experienced temporary S-band power amplifier failures during the
mission.
The Manned Space Flight Network support of the scientific experiment package was
good. A few hardware and procedural problems were encountered; however, the only signifi-
cant data loss occurred when the S-band parametric amplifier at the Canary Island station
failed only seconds before the lunar module ascent. Consequently, all seismic package
data were lost during this phase, since no backup stations were available for support.
Television support provided by Manned Space Flight Network and Jet Propulsion Lab-
oratory facilities, particularly that provided by the 210-foot stations at Parkes and
Goldstone, was good throughout the mission.
Recovery Operations
The Department of Defense provided recovery support commensurate with the probability
of landing within a specified area and with any special problems associated with such a
landing. Recovery force deployment was nearly identical to that for Apollo 8 and 10.
Support for the primary landing area in the Pacific Ocean was provided by the U.S.S.
Hornet. Air support consisted of four SH-3D helicopters from the U.S.S. Hornet, three
E-1B aircraft, three Apollo range instrumentation aircraft, and two HC-130 rescue air-
craft staged from Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. Two of the E-1B aircraft were designated
as "Air Doss," and the third was a communications relay aircraft. Two of the SH-3D heli-
copters carried the swimmers and the required recovery equipment. The third SH-3D
helicopter was used as a photographic platform, and the fourth, which carried the decon-
tamination swimmer and the flight surgeon, was used for crew retrieval.
169

--- PAGE 183 ---
The command module immediately went to the stable II (apex down) flotation attitude
after landing. The uprighting system returned the spacecraft to the stable I attitude
7 minutes 40 seconds later. One or 2 quarts of water entered the spacecraft while it
was in the stable II position. The swimmers were deployed to install the flotation col-
lar; the decontamination swimmer then passed the biological isolation garments to the
flightcrew, assisted the crew into the liferaft, and decontaminated the exterior surface
of the command module. (See "Lunar Contamination and Quarantine" in section 12.) After
the command module hatch was closed and decontaminated, the flightcrew and decontamination
swimmer washed each other with the decontaminate solution prior to being taken aboard the
recovery helicopter. The crew arrived on board the U.S.S. Hornet at 17:53 G.m.t. and
entered the Mobile Quarantine Facility 5 minutes later. The first lunar samples to be
returned were flown to Johnston Island, placed aboard a C-141 aircraft, and flown to
Houston. Approximately 6-1/2 hours later, the second sample shipment was flown from the
U.S.S. Hornet directly to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and placed aboard a range
instrumentation aircraft for transfer to Houston.
The command module and Mobile Quarantine Facility were offloaded in Hawaii on
July 27, 1969. The Mobile Quarantine Facility was loaded aboard a C-141 aircraft and
flown to Houston, Texas, where a brief ceremony was held. The flightcrew arrived at the
Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 G.m.t. on July 28, 1969.
The command module was taken to Ford Island for deactivation. Upon completion of
deactivation, the command module was shipped to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and flown
on a C-133 aircraft to Houston. A postrecovery inspection showed no significant dis-
crepancies in the spacecraft.

14. ASSESSMENT OF MISSION OBJECTIVES
The single primary mission objective for the Apollo 11 mission (as defined in the
NASA Headquarters document OMSF M-D MA 500-11 (SE 010-000-1) entitled "Apollo Flight
Mission Assignments" and prepared July 11, 1969) was to perform a manned lunar land-
ing and return safely to earth. In addition to the single primary objective, 11 sec-
ondary objectives were delineated from the following two general categories:
1. To perform selenological inspection and sampling
2. To obtain data to assess the capability and limitations of a man and his
equipment in the lunar environment
The 11 secondary objectives are listed in table 14-I and are described in detail in
NASA Manned Spacecraft Center document SPD 9-R-038 (entitled "Mission Requirements,
SA-506/CSM-107/LM-5, G Type Mission Lunar Landing," April 17, 1969).
The following experiments were assigned to the Apollo 11 mission:
1. Passive seismic experiment (S-031)
2. Lunar field geology (S-059)
3. Laser ranging retroreflector (S-078)
4. Solar wind composition (S-080)
5. Cosmic ray detection (S-151)
The single primary objective was met. All secondary objectives and experiments
except for the following were fully satisfied:
1. Objective G: location of the landed lunar module
2. Experiment S-059: lunar field geology
These two items were not completely satisfied in the manner planned before flight. A
discussion of the deficiencies appears in the following paragraphs. A full assessment
of the Apollo 11 detailed objectives and experiments will be presented in separate
reports.

Location of the Landed Lunar Module
It was planned to make a near-real-time determination of the location of the landed
lunar module, based on crew observations. Observations by the lunar module crew during
descent and after landing were to provide information for locating the landing point by
using onboard maps. In addition, this information was to be transmitted to the Command
Module Pilot, who was to use the sextant in an attempt to locate the landed lunar module.
Furthermore, if it were not possible for the Command Module Pilot to resolve the lunar
module in the sextant, he was to track a nearby landmark that had a known location rela-
tive to the landed lunar module (as determined by the lunar module crew or the ground
team).
175

--- PAGE 188 ---
This near-real-time determination of the landed lunar module location by the lunar
module crew was not accomplished because the crew's attention was confined to the cabin
during most of the visibility phase of the descent. Consequently, their observations
of the lunar features during descent were not sufficient to allow them to judge their
position. The crew's observation of the large crater near the landing point did provide
an important clue to their location, but this clue was not sufficient to locate the
landing point with confidence.
On several orbital passes, the Command Module Pilot used the sextant in an attempt
to locate the lunar module. His observations were directed to areas where ground
data indicated the lunar module could have landed. These attempts to locate the lunar
module were unsuccessful, and it is doubtful that the Command Module Pilot's observations
were ever directed to the area where the lunar module was actually located.
Near the end of the lunar surface stay, the location of the landed lunar module was
determined from the lunar module rendezvous-radar tracking data (confirmed postflight
by using descent photographic data). However, the Command Module Pilot's activities
did not permit his attempting another tracking pass after the lunar module location had
been determined accurately.
Lunar Field Geology
For the Apollo 11 mission, the documented sample collection (Experiment S-059,
lunar field geology) was assigned the lowest priority of any of the scientific objec-
tives and was planned as one of the last activities during the extravehicular activity
period. Two core-tube samples were collected as planned, and approximately 15 pounds
of additional lunar samples were obtained as part of this objective. However, time
constraints on the extravehicular activity precluded collection of these samples with
the degree of documentation originally planned.
In addition, there was not sufficient time to allow the collection of a lunar
environment sample or a gas analysis sample in the two special containers provided.
Although these samples were not obtained in their special containers, it was possible
to obtain the desired results by using other samples contained in the regular sample
return containers.

15. LAUNCH VEHICLE SUMMARY
The trajectory parameters of the AS-506 launch vehicle from launch to translunar
injection were all close to the expected values. The vehicle was launched on an
azimuth 90° east of north. A roll maneuver was initiated at 13.2 seconds in order to
place the vehicle on the planned flight azimuth of 72.058° east of north.
Following lunar module ejection, the S-IVB/instrument unit maneuvered to a sling-
shot attitude that was fixed relative to the local horizontal. The retrograde velocity
necessary to perform the lunar slingshot maneuver was accomplished by a liquid oxygen
dump, an auxiliary propulsion system firing, and liquid hydrogen venting. The closest
approach of the vehicle to the lunar surface was 1825 miles at 78:42:00. A flight
evaluation report containing additional data on the launch vehicle performance has been
published by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (entitled "Saturn V Launch Vehicle
Flight Evaluation Report AS-506, Apollo 11 Mission, "Report MPR-SAT-FE-69-9, Sept. 20,
1969).

16. ANOMALY SUMMARY
This section contains a discussion of the significant problems or discrepancies
noted during the Apollo 11 mission.
Command and Service Modules
Service propulsion nitrogen leak.- During the lunar orbit insertion firing, the
gaseous nitrogen in the redundant service propulsion engine actuation system decayed
from 2307 to 1883 psia (fig. 16-1), which indicated a leak downstream of the injector
prevalve. The normal pressure decay as experienced by the primary system is approximately
50 psia for each firing. Only one system was affected, and no performance degradation
resulted. This actuation system was used during the transearth injection firing, and no
leakage was detected.

Figure 16-1.- Nitrogen pressure during initial lunar orbit insertion firing.
The fuel and oxidizer valves are controlled by actuators driven by nitrogen pressure.
Figure 16-2 is representative of both nitrogen control systems. When power is applied
to the service propulsion system in preparation for a maneuver, the injector prevalve is
opened; however, pressure is not applied to the actuators, because the solenoid control
valves are closed. When the engine is commanded on, the solenoid control valves are
opened, pressure is applied to the actuator, and the rack on the actuator shaft drives a
pinion gear to open the fuel and oxidizer valves. When the engine is commanded off, the
solenoid control valve vents the actuator and closes the fuel and oxidizer valves.

The most probable cause of the problem was contamination of one of the components
downstream of the injector prevalve, which isolates the nitrogen supply during nonfiring
periods. The injector prevalve was not considered a problem source because it was
opened 2 minutes before ignition, and no leakage occurred during that period. The
possibility that the regulator and relief valve were leaking was also eliminated because
pressure was applied to these components when the prevalve was opened.
The solenoid control valves have a history of leakage, which has occurred either
because of improper internal airgap adjustment or because of seal damage caused by con-
tamination. The airgap adjustment could not have caused the leakage, because an improper
airgap with the prevalves open would have caused the leak to remain constant. Both of
the solenoid control valves in the leaking system had been found to be contaminated be-
fore flight and were removed from the system, rebuilt, and successfully retested during
the acceptance test cycle.
It is concluded that the leakage was due to a contamination-induced failure of a
solenoid control valve. The source of contamination is unknown; however, the contamina-
tion was apparently removed from the sealing surface during the valve closure for the
first lunar orbit insertion maneuver (fig. 16-2). The suspected source is a contaminated
facility manifold at the vendor's plant. Although an investigation of the prior failure
indicated that the flight valve was not contaminated, the facility manifold is still con-
sidered a possible source of the contaminants.
179

--- PAGE 192 ---
Spacecraft for Apollo 12 and subsequent missions have integral filters installed,
and the facility manifolds are controlled more closely; therefore, no further corrective
action was taken.
This anomaly is closed.
Cryogenic heater failure.- The performance of the automatic pressure control system
indicated that one of the two heater elements in oxygen tank 2 was inoperative. Data
showing heater currents for prelaunch checkout verified that both heater elements were
operational through the countdown demonstration test. However, the readings recorded for
current during the tank pressurization in the launch countdown showed that one heater in
oxygen tank 2 had failed. This information was not made known to proper channels for
disposition prior to the flight because no specification limits were called out in the
test procedure.
Manufacturing records for all Block II oxygen tanks showed that there have been no
thermal-switch nor electrical-continuity failures in the program; two failures occurred
during the insulation resistance tests. One failure was attributed to moisture in the
connector. After this unit had been dried, it passed all acceptance tests. The other
failure was identified in the heater assembly before it was installed in a tank. This
failure, which was also an insulation problem, would not have prevented the heater from
functioning normally.
The cause of the flight failure was probably an intermittent contact on a terminal
board in the heater circuit. The 16-gage wiring at the board has exhibited intermit-
tencies several times in the past. This board is the same type of terminal board that
was found to be the cause of the control engine problem on Apollo 11. (See "Failure of
Automatic Coil in One Thruster" in this section.) Since the oxygen tank heaters are
redundant, no mission constraints were created other than a requirement for more frequent
quantity balancing.
The launch-site test requirements were changed to specify the amperage level neces-
sary to verify that both tank heaters were operational. Additionally, all launch-site
procedures were reviewed to determine whether specification limits are required in other
areas.
This anomaly is closed.
Failure of automatic coil in one thruster.- The minus-yaw engine in command module
reaction control system 1 produced low and erratic thrust in response to firing commands
through the automatic coils of the engine valves. The spacecraft rates verified that
the engine performed normally when fired by using the direct coils.
Electrical continuity through at least one of the parallel automatic coils in the
engine was evidenced by the fact that the stabilization and control system driver signals
were normal. This behavior, along with the fact that at least some thrust was produced,
indicates that one of the two valves was working normally.
At the launch site, another engine undergoing checkout had failed to respond to
commands during the valve signature tests. The problem was isolated to a faulty termi-
nal board connector. The faulty terminal board was replaced, and the systems were re-
tested satisfactorily. Because of this incident and because of the previous history of
problems with terminal boards, these connectors were prime suspects when engine problems
occurred.
Postflight tests showed that two pins in the terminal board (fig. 16-3) were loose
and caused intermittent continuity to the automatic coils of the engine valve. This type

Loss of electroluminescent segment in
the entry monitor system. - An electrolumi-
nescent segment on the numeric display of
the entry monitor system velocity counter
would not illuminate. The segment is independently switched through a logic network
that activates a silicon-controlled rectifier to bypass the light when it is not
illuminated. The power source is 115 volts, 400 hertz.
Four cases of similar malfunctions have been recorded. One case involved a segment
that would not illuminate, and three cases involved segments that would not turn off.
In each case, the cause was identified as misrouting of logic wires in the circuit con-
trolling the rectifiers. The misrouting bent the wires across terminal strips containing
sharp wire ends. These sharp ends punctured the insulation and caused shorts to ground
or to +4 volts, turning the segment off or on, respectively.
A rework of the affected circuits took place in the process of soldering crimp
joints that had been involved in an Apollo 7 anomaly. An inspection to detect mis-
routing was conducted at this time; however, because of potting restrictions, the in-
spection was limited. A number of other failure mechanisms exist in circuit elements
and leads; however, there is no associated failure history. A generic or design problem

The preflight checkout program was examined to identify possibilities for improve-
ment in assuring proper operation of all segments throughout all operating conditions.
This anomaly is closed.
Oxygen flow master alarms. - During the initial lunar module pressurization, two
master alarms were activated when the oxygen flow rate was decreasing from full scale.
The same condition had been observed several times during altitude chamber tests and
during subsequent troubleshooting. The cause of the problem could not be identified
before launch, but the only consequence of the alarms was the nuisance factor.
Figure 16-4 shows the basic elements of the oxygen flow sensing circuit. Note in
figure 16-4 that, for a master alarm to occur, relay K1 must hold in for 16 seconds,
after which time relays K2 and K3 will close, activating a master alarm.

Indicated closure of propellant isolation valves.- The propellant isolation valves
module separation from the S-IVB. A similar problem was encountered on the Apollo 9
on quad B of the service module reaction control system closed during command and service
mission. Tests after Apollo 9 indicated that a valve with normal magnetic latch forces
would close at shock levels as low as 87g with an ll-millisecond duration; however, with
durations in the expected range of 0.2 to 0.5 millisecond, shock levels as high as 670g
would not close the valves. The expected shock range is 180g to 260g.
Two valves having the nominal latching force of 7 pounds were selected for shock
testing. It was found that shocks of 80g for 10 milliseconds to shocks of 100g for
1 millisecond would close the valves. The latching forces for the valves were reduced to
5 pounds, and the valves were shock tested again. The shock required to close the valves
at this reduced latching force was 54g for 10 milliseconds and 75g for 1 millisecond.
After completion of the shock testing, the valves were examined and tested, and no degra-
dation was noted. Higher shock levels may have been experienced in flight, and further
tests will be conducted.
A review of the checkout procedures indicates that the latching force can be degraded
only if improper procedures are implemented, such as the application of reverse current
or ac to the circuit. A special test on Apollo 12 indicated that the valve latching
force was not degraded.
Because there was no valve degradation when the valve was shocked closed and because
the crew checklist contained precautionary information concerning these valves, no further
action was necessary.
This anomaly is closed.
Odor in docking tunnel.- An odor similar to burned wire insulation was detected in
the tunnel when the hatch was first opened. No evidence of discoloration nor indications
of overheating of the electrical circuits could be found when the circuits were examined
by the crew during the flight. Several other sources of the odor were investigated,
182

--- PAGE 195 ---
including burned particles from tower jettison, outgassing of a silicone lubricant used
on the hatch seal, and outgassing of other components used in the tunnel area. Odors
from these sources were reproduced for the crew to compare with the odors detected
during flight. The crew stated that the odor from a sample of the docking hatch ablator
was similar to that detected in flight. Apparently, removal of the outer insulation
(TG-15000) from the hatch of Apollo 11 (and of subsequent spacecraft) resulted in higher
ablator temperatures and, therefore, a larger amount of outgassing odor than on previous
flights.
This anomaly is closed.
Low oxygen flow rate. Shortly after launch, the oxygen flow rate indication was at
the lower limit of the instrumentation rather than at the nominal metabolic rate of
0.3 1b/hr. Also, during water separator cyclic accumulator cycles, the flow rate
indication was less than the expected full measurement output of 1.0 lb/hr.
Analysis of associated data indicated that the oxygen flow was normal, but that the
indicated flow rate was negatively biased by approximately 1.5 1b/hr. Postflight tests
of the transducer confirmed this bias, and the cause was associated with a change in the
heater winding resistance within the flow sensor bridge (fig. 16-5). The resistance of
the heater had increased from 1000 to 1600 ohms, therefore changing the temperature of
the hot wire element that supplies the reference voltage for the balance of the bridge.
Further testing to determine the cause of the resistance change was not practical because
of the minute size of the potted resistive element. Depotting of the element would de-
stroy available evidence of the cause of failure. Normally, heater resistance changes
occur early in the 100-hour burn-in period during which heater stability is achieved.

and its function is to break the wraps during

Figure 16-5.- Oxygen flow sensor.
The knots should be two closely tied
half-hitches that secure the tie-wrap to the
lanyard (fig. 16-6). Examination of the Apollo 10 lanyard indicated that these knots
were not two half-hitches but a clove hitch (fig. 16-6). Spacecraft 110 and 111 were
examined, and it was found that a clove hitch was erroneously used on these vehicles also.
After the lanyard breaks the tie-wraps, if the fragment of tie-wrap pulls out of
the knot, the clove hitch knot can untie, thus lengthening the lanyard. Lengthening this
lanyard as the umbilical cable pays out can allow transfer of some loading into the umbil-
ical disconnect fittings. Should a sufficient load be transferred to the disconnect fit-
ting to cause shearpins to fail, the mortar umbilical of the forward heat shield could be
disconnected prior to the mortar firing. This disconnection would prevent deployment of
the forward heat shield separation-augmentation parachute, and there would be a possi-
bility of forward heat shield recontact with the command module. Examination of the
forward heat shield recovered from Apollo 10 confirmed that the mortar had fired and
that the parachute was properly deployed.

Glycol temperature control valve. During lunar orbit operations, the glycol temper-
ature control valve did not control the evaporator inlet temperature. The temperature of
the water/glycol entering the evaporator is normally maintained above 42° F by the gly-
col temperature control valve, which mixes hot water/glycol with water/glycol returning
from the radiators (fig. 16-7). As the radiator outlet temperature decreases, the tem-
perature control valve opens to allow more hot glycol to mix with the cold fluid return-
ing from the radiator. This procedure is followed to maintain the evaporator inlet
temperature at 42° to 48° F. The control valve starts to close as the radiator outlet
temperature increases and closes completely at evaporator inlet temperatures above 48° F.
If the automatic temperature control system fails, manual operation of the temperature
control valve is available by deactivating the automatic mode. This deactivation is
accomplished by positioning the glycol evaporator temperature inlet switch from AUTO to
MANUAL, which removes power from the control circuit.

The control valve was removed from the spacecraft, disassembled, and inspected. A
bearing within the valve gear train was found to have its retainer disengaged from the
race so that the retainer interfered with the worm gear travel (fig. 16-9).
The valve gear train is driven into mechanical stops and is stalled when the valve
is commanded full open or closed. Analysis of the failed bearing and the gear train de-
sign indicates that high static thrust loads (74 pounds) applied to the bearing when the
gear train is stalled caused the failure. The bearing is rated for 20 pounds of static
thrust.
The capability to set the valve manually at a position that will maintain the nor-
mal temperature range of the system precludes the necessity of a redesign.

Service module entry. The service module jettisoning sequence was designed with
the intention that the service module, upon being jettisoned on a lunar return flight,
would enter the atmosphere of the earth to between 300 and 400 thousand feet of altitude
and then skip out into a highly elliptical earth orbit. Thus, the risk of recontact
with the command module during entry would be eliminated. However, on the Apollo 8, 10,
and 11 missions, the service module did not skip out as expected.
Tracking data obtained by C-band radar on the Apollo 11 mission indicated that the
separation velocity was much less than that expected. During the Apollo 11 mission, the
service module was seen by the crew approximately 5 minutes after it had been jettisoned;
this sighting could not have occurred if the service module had followed its expected

approximately 300 ft/sec should have been
obtained for a stable service module, and
this separation velocity is more than suf-
ficient to cause the service module to skip
out. The separation velocity for the
Apollo 10 mission was approximately 60 ft/
sec (30 ft/sec less than the miniumum ve-
locity required for skip out.)

successive missions of the occurrence of the
failure of the service module to skip out.
Analysis of propellant sloshing shows, how-
ever, that the service module can become unstable, which results in low net separation
velocities. Pictorial representation of the sloshing is shown in figure 16-10. The
analyses indicate that tip-off moments applied to the service module at jettison cause
the spin vector to precess about the service module X-axis. The precession excites
longitudinal sloshing of the propellants in the tanks. Initial propellant locations are
shown in heavy shading in figure 16-10. When the spin vector precesses to the other side
of the X-axis, the propellants are driven to the other ends of the tanks, as shown in
light shading. The sloshing then causes the spin vector to approach a position normal
to the service module X-axis. The sloshing effects can cause a reduction in separation
velocity, and during the 300-second thrusting period, the service module attitude can be
reversed 180°. This condition introduces a remote possibility of recontact between the
service module and the command module.
Analysis showed that the optimum separation velocity for a range of propellant loads
can be obtained by restricting the roll thrusting to a period of 2 seconds and the X-axis
thrusting to a period of 25 seconds. Therefore, beginning with the Apollo 13 mission,
the service module jettison controller was modified to give the following jettison
sequence.

cause of the failure was a cracked solder
joint. The reason for the cracked solder
joint was the cordwood construction; that
is, electrical components (resistors, capacitors, diodes, etc.) were soldered between two
circuit boards, and the void between the boards was filled with potting compound
(fig. 16-11). The differential expansion between the potting compound and the component
leads caused the solder joints to crack and break electrical contact. Presumably, the
11-hour period the timer was off allowed the timer to cool sufficiently for the cracked
joint to make electrical contact, and the timer then operated normally.
There was no practical solution to the problem for units that were installed for
the Apollo 12 mission. However, to decrease the probability of failure, a screening pro-
cedure (vibration and thermal test and 50 hours of operation) has been used to select
timers for vehicle installation. The Apollo 11 timer was exposed to vibration and thermal
tests and to 36 hours of operation prior to installation.
New mission timers and event timers that will be mechanically and electrically inter-
changeable with present timers are being developed. These new timers will use integrated
circuits welded on printed circuit boards instead of the cordwood construction and will
include design changes associated with the other timer problems such as cracked glass
and electromagnetic interference susceptibility. The new timers will be incorporated
into the spacecraft when qualification testing is complete.

water separator and allowed the condensate
that had collected in the separator to drain
into a tank (fig. 16-13). The drain tank contained a honeycomb material designed to re-
tain the condensate. If the amount of condensate exceeded the effective surface of the
honeycomb, water could have leaked through the vent line and into the system just up

formance. The carbon dioxide content is sensed by measuring the light transmission
across a stream of suit-loop gas. Any liquid in the element affects the light transmis-
sion and thus gives improper readings. To preclude water being introduced into the
sensor from the drain tank, the vent line was relocated to an existing boss upstream of
the fans, effective on Apollo 13 (fig. 16-13).

Steerable antenna acquisition. When the steerable antenna was selected after acqui-
sition on revolution 14, difficulty was encountered in maintaining communications. The
down-link signal strength was lower than predicted and several times decreased to the
level at which lock was lost. However, the nominal performance of the steerable antenna
before and after the time in question indicated that the antenna hardware operated
properly.
For the pointing angles used, errors were discovered in the antenna coverage re-
striction diagram in the Spacecraft Operational Data Book. In addition, the diagram
failed to include the thruster plume deflectors, which were added to the lunar module at
the launch site. Figure 16-14 shows the correct blockage diagram and the diagram that was
used in the Spacecraft Operational Data Book prior to flight. The pointing angles of the
antenna were in an area of blockage or sufficiently close to blockage to affect the cover-
age pattern. As the antenna boresight approaches the vehicle structure, the on-boresight
gain is reduced, the selectivity to incoming signals is reduced, and sidelobe interfer-
ence is increased. Furthermore, a preflight analysis showed that the multipath signal, or
reflected ray (fig. 16-15), from the lunar surface to the vehicle flight trajectory would
be sufficient to cause some of the antenna tracking losses. Also, the reduction in an-
tenna selectivity caused by vehicle blockage increases the probability of multipath inter-
ferences in the antenna tracking circuits. In conclusion, both the vehicle blockage and
the multipath signals probably contributed to the reduced measured signal.

scheduling and job-supervising routine which
allocates the required erasable memory stor-
age for each job request and decides which
job is given control of the central processor.
The Executive program schedules the various repetitive routines or jobs (such as Servicer,
the navigation and guidance job which is done every 2 seconds) on an open-loop basis with
respect to whether the job scheduled on the previous cycle was completed. Should the
completion of a job be slowed because high-frequency counter interrupts usurp excessive
central processor time, the Executive program will schedule the same job again and re-
serve another memory storage area for its use. When the Executive program is requested
to schedule a job and all locations are assigned, a program alarm is displayed and a
software restart is initiated. A review of the jobs that can run during descent led to
the conclusion that multiple scheduling of the same job produced the program alarms.
The cause for the multiple scheduling of jobs has been identified by analyses and simula-
tions to be primarily counter interrupts from the rendezvous-radar coupling data unit.
The interrupts during the powered descent resulted from the configuration of the
rendezvous-radar/coupling data unit/computer interface. A schematic of the interface is
shown in figure 16-16. When the rendezvous-radar mode switch is in the AUTO or SLEW
position, the excitation for the radar shaft and trunnion resolvers is supplied by a
28-volt, 800-hertz signal from the attitude and translation control assembly. When the
switch is in the LGC position, the positioning of the radar antenna is controlled by the
guidance computer, and the resolver excitation is supplied by a 28-volt, 800-hertz source
in the primary guidance and navigation control system. The output signals of the shaft
and trunnion resolvers interface with the coupling data units, regardless of the exci-
tation source. The attitude and translation control assembly voltage is locked in fre-
quency with the primary guidance and navigation control system voltage through control
(by the primary guidance and navigation control system) of the PCM and timing electronics
frequency, but it is not locked in phase. When a mode switch is not in LGC, the attitude
and translation control assembly voltage is the source for the resolver output signals
to the coupling data units, while the primary guidance and navigation control system
800-hertz voltage is used as a reference voltage in the analog-to-digital conversion
portion of the coupling data unit. Any difference in phase or amplitude between the
two 800-hertz voltages will cause the coupling data unit to recognize a change in shaft
or trunnion position, and the coupling data unit will "slew" (digitally). The "slewing"
191

--- PAGE 204 ---
of the data unit results in the undesirable and continuous transmission of pulses rep-
resenting incremental angular changes to the computer. The maximum rate for the pulses
is 6.4 kpps, and the pulses are processed as counter interrupts. Each pulse received
by the computer requires one memory cycle time (11.7 microseconds) to process. If a maxi-
mum of 12.8 kpps is received (two radar coupling data units), 15 percent of the available
computer time will be spent in processing the radar interrupts. (The computer normally
operates at approximately 90 percent of capacity during the peak activity of powered de-
scent.) When the capacity of the computer is exceeded, some repetitively scheduled rou-
tines will not be completed prior to the start of the next computation cycle. The
computer then generates a software restart and displays an Executive overflow alarm.
The meaningless counter interrupts from the rendezvous-radar coupling data unit will
not be processed by the Luminary 1B program used on future missions. When the radar is
not powered up or the mode switch is not in the LGC position, the data units will be
zeroed, and counter interrupts will not be generated by the radar coupling data units.
An additional change will permit the crew to monitor the descent without requiring as
much computer time as was required in Luminary 1A.
This anomaly is closed.
Slow cabin decompression. The decompression of the cabin prior to extravehicular
activity required longer than had been anticipated. In analysis of the seriousness of
this problem, it was determined that the crew cannot damage the hatch by trying to open
it prematurely. Static tests show that a handle force of 78 pounds at 0.25 psid and
118 pounds at 0.35 psid is required to permit airflow past the seal. The hatch deflected
only in the region of the handle. A handle pull of 300 pounds at 2 psid did not damage
either the handle or the hatch. In addition, neutral buoyancy tests showed that suited
subjects in a 1/6-g environment could pull a maximum of 102 pounds.
On Apollo 12 and subsequent vehicles, the bacteria filter was not to be used; thus,
the time for decompression was reduced from approximately 5 minutes to less than 2 minutes.
The altitude chamber test for Apollo 13 included a partial cabin vent procedure that
verified satisfactory valve assembly operation without the bacteria filter installed.

Electroluminescent segment on display inoperative. An electroluminescent segment
on the numeric display of the abort guidance system data entry and display assembly was
reported inoperative. The affected digit is shown in figure 16-17. With this segment
inoperative, it was impossible to differentiate between the numerals 3 and 9. The crew
was still able to use the particular digit; however, there was some ambiguity on the
readout.
Each segment on the display is switched independently through a logic network that
activates a silicon-controlled rectifier placed in series with the segments. In this
respect, the control circuit is different from that used in the entry monitor system
velocity counter, although both units are made by the same manufacturer. (See "Loss of
Electroluminescent Segment in Entry Monitor System" in this section.) The power source
is 115 volts, 400 hertz, and can be varied for intensity control.

activity.- Voice-operated relay operation
during extravehicular activity caused break-
up of voice received by the Manned Space

Flight Network. This breakup was associated
with both crewmen, but primarily with the
Lunar Module Pilot.

duplicated by decreasing the sensitivity of
the lunar module down-link voice-operated
keying control from 9 (maximum) to 8, a de-
crease of approximately 7 decibels. During
chamber tests, lunar module keying by the extravehicular communications system was demon-
strated when the sensitivity control was set at 9. The crew indicated that the pre-
extravehicular activity adjustment should have been set in accordance with the onboard
checklist (maximum increase). The crewmen also verified that they did not experience any
voice breakup from each other or from the Manned Space Flight Network, which indicated
that the breakup was probably caused by marginal keying of the voice-operated keying
circuits of the lunar module down-link relay.
Voice tapes of the Apollo 11 crew obtained during altitude chamber tests were used
in an attempt to duplicate the problem by simulating voice modulation characteristics
and levels being fed into the lunar module communications system during the extravehicu-
lar activity. These voice tapes modulated a signal generator that was received by and
relayed through a breadboard (mockup) of the lunar module communications system. No
discernible breakup of the relayed voice occurred with the sensitivity control set at 9.
All analysis and laboratory testing to date indicates that the voice breakup experi-
enced during the extravehicular activity was not an inherent system design problem.
Testing has shown that any voice that will key the extravehicular communications system
will also key the lunar module relay if the sensitivity control is set at 9.
The most probable cause of the problem is an inadvertent low setting of the Com-
mander's sensitivity control. During extravehicular activity, both crewmen use the Com-
mander's lunar module voice-operated circuit when talking to the ground. Other less
likely causes are degraded modulation from the extravehicular communications system or
193

--- PAGE 206 ---
degradation of the lunar module circuit gain between the vhf receiver and the Commander's
amplifier. However, no known previous failures have resulted in degraded extravehicular
communications modulation levels or degraded lunar module keying performance.
This anomaly is closed.
Echo during extravehicular activity. - A voice turnaround (echo) was heard during
extravehicular activity. At that time, the lunar module was operating in a relay mode.
Up-link voice from the S-band was processed and retransmitted to the two extravehicular
crewmen by means of the lunar module vhf transmitter. Crew voice and data were received
by the lunar module vhf receiver and relayed to the earth by means of the lunar module
S-band transmitter (fig. 16-18). The echo, which was duplicated in the laboratory,
resulted from mechanical acoustical coupling between the communications carrier earphone

and microphone (fig. 16-19). The crewmen indicated that their volume controls were set
at maximum during the extravehicular activity. This setting would provide a level of
approximately +16 dBm into each crewman's earphones. Isolation between earphones and
microphones, exclusive of airpath coupling, is approximately 48 decibels. Therefore,
at the microphone output, the ground voice signal would appear at a level of approximately
-32 dBm. If it is assumed that extravehicular communications keying was enabled, this
signal would be processed and transmitted by the extravehicular communications system and
would provide a level of approximately -12 dBm at the output of the lunar module vhf re-
ceiver. If the lunar module relay was enabled, this signal would be amplified and relayed
to earth by means of the S-band at a nominal output level.
When the lunar module voice-operated
keying circuit is properly adjusted, any sig-
nal that keys the extravehicular communica-
tions system will also key the lunar module
relay. There are indications that the lunar
module voice-operated keying sensitivity was

cuits in the extravehicular communications
system were activated by suit airflow for
some positions of the head in the helmet.
Both voice-operated keying circuits were also keyed by bumping or rubbing of the communi-
cations carrier against the helmet. The random echo problem is inherent in the communi-
cations system design, and there does not appear to be any practical way to eliminate
random voice-operated keying or to significantly reduce the acoustical coupling in the
communications carrier.
A procedure to inhibit the remoting of down-link voice during periods of up-link
voice transmissions will be accomplished to eliminate the echo. The capsule communica-
tor's console will be modified to allow capsule-communicator simplex operation (up link
only, down link disabled) during up-link transmissions as a backup mode of operation if
the echo becomes objectionable. However, the ground system will still have the echo of
the capsule communicator when the simplex mode is used.
This anomaly is closed.
Onboard recorder failure.- The data storage electronics assembly did not record
properly in flight. Postflight playback of the tape revealed that the reference tone
was recorded properly; however, the voice signal was low and recorded with a 400-hertz
tone and strong background noise. Occasionally, the voice level was normal for short
periods. In addition, only the 4.6-kilohertz timing signal was recorded. This signal
should have switched between 4.2 and 4.6 kilohertz in order to record the timing code.
195

--- PAGE 208 ---
During postflight tests, the recorder functioned properly for the first 2 hours of
operation. Then, the voice channel failed and recorded no voice or background noise,
although timing and reference tones were recorded properly. This failure does not dupli-
cate the flight results, which indicated that the failure did not exist in flight.
Tests with the recorder installed in a lunar module were performed to determine the
vehicle wiring failures that could cause the signals found on the flight tape. An open
circuit in both the timing signal return line and the voice signal line would duplicate
the problem. Similar broken wires were found in LTA-8 during thermal/vacuum tests. The
most probable cause of the failure was two broken wires (26 gage) in the vehicle harness
to the recorder. For Apollo 12 to 15, the wire harness at the recorder connector will
be wrapped with tape to stiffen the connector and provide protection against flexure
damage. For Apollo 16 and subsequent missions, a sheet-metal cover will be added to
protect the harness.
Preflight data from the launch-site checkout procedure show that both the timing
inputs and the internally generated reference frequency were not within specification
tolerances, which may be indicative of a preflight problem with the system. The procedure
did not specify acceptable limits but has now been corrected.
This anomaly is closed.
Broken circuit breaker knob. - The crew reported after the completion of extravehicu-
lar activity that the knob on the engine arm circuit breaker was broken and that two
other circuit breakers were closed. The engine arm circuit breaker was successfully
closed when required for ascent, but loss of the knob would not allow manual opening of
the breaker.
The most probable cause of the damage was impact with the oxygen purge system (aft
edge) during preparation for extravehicular activities; such an impact was demonstrated
in simulations in a lunar module. Circuit breaker guards will be installed on Apollo 12
and subsequent vehicles to prevent the oxygen purge system from impacting with the circuit
breakers.
This anomaly is closed.
Thrust chamber pressure switches.- The switch used to monitor the quad 2 aft-firing
engine (A2A) exhibited slow response to jet driver commands during most of the mission.
During an 18-minute period just prior to terminal phase initiation, the switch failed to
respond to seven consecutive minimum-impulse commands. This failure resulted in a master
alarm and a thruster warning flag, both of which were reset by the crew. The engine oper-
ated normally, and the switch failure had no effect on the mission. The crew did not
attempt any investigative procedures to determine whether the engine had actually failed.
A section drawing of the switch is shown in figure 16-20.

This failure was the first of its type to be observed in flight or in ground testing.
The switch closing response (time of jet driver ON command to switch closure) appeared
to increase from an average of approximately 15 to 20 milliseconds during station keeping
to 25 to 30 milliseconds at the time of failure. Normal switch closing response is 10 to
12 milliseconds, based on ground test results. The closing response remained at the
25- to 30-millisecond level following the failure, and the switch continued to fail to
respond to some minimum-impulse commands. The switch opening time (time from jet driver
OFF command to switch opening) appeared to be normal throughout the mission. In view of
these results, the most probable cause of the switch failure was particulate contamina-
tion in the inlet passage of the switch. Contamination in this area would reduce the
flow rate of chamber gases into the diaphragm cavity, thereby reducing the switch closing
response. However, the contamination would not necessarily affect switch opening response
because normal chamber pressure tailoff requires approximately 30 to 40 milliseconds in
order to decrease from approximately 30 psia to the normal switch opening pressure of
approximately 4 psia. The 30- to 40-millisecond time would probably be sufficient to
allow the gases in the diaphragm cavity to vent such that the switch would open normally.
The crews for future missions will be briefed to recognize and handle similar situations.
This anomaly is closed.
Water in one suit.- After the lunar module achieved orbit, water (estimated to be
1 tablespoonful) began to enter the Commander's suit in spurts at approximately 1-minute
intervals. The Commander immediately selected the secondary water separator, and the
spurts stopped after 15 to 20 minutes. The spurts entered the suit through the suit
half-vent duct when the crewmen were not wearing their helmets. The pressures in all
liquid systems that interface with the suit loop were normal, which indicated no leakage.
197

--- PAGE 210 ---
The possible sources of free water in the suit loop are the water separator drain
tank, an inoperative water separator, local condensation in the suit loop, and leakage
through the water separator selector valve (fig. 16-13). An evaluation of each of these
possible sources indicated that leakage through the water separator selector valve was
the most probable source of the free water.
The flapper-type valve is located in a Y-duct arrangement and is used to select one
of two water separators. Leakage of this valve would allow free water to pass through
the idle water separator and subsequently enter the suit hose. This leakage would most
probably result from a misalinement and binding in the slot of the selector valve actua-
tion linkage (fig. 16-21).
The allowable actuation force after
linkage rigging was 15 pounds. The usual
actuation forces have been 7 to 8 pounds,
but 12.5 pounds were required on the Apol-
lo 11 mission. The allowable actuation
force has been lowered to 10 pounds, and in-
spections for linkage binding have been in-
corporated into procedures at the factory
and the launch site.

2. Firing of opposing thrusters may
have caused a thrust-chamber-on failure indi-
cation.
3. Erroneous caution and warning system or display flag operation may have occurred.
The first two possible causes are unlikely because simultaneous multiple failures
would have to occur and subsequently be corrected. The third possible cause is the most
likely to have occurred where a single-point failure existed. Ten of the 16 engine
pressure switch outputs are conditioned by the 10 buffers in one module in the signal
conditioner electronics assembly (fig. 16-22). This module is supplied with +28 V dc
through one wire. In addition, the module contains an oscillator that provides an

Television cable retained coiled shape. - The cable for the lunar surface television
camera retained its coiled shape after being deployed on the lunar surface. Loops
resulting from the coils represented a potential tripping hazard to the crew.
All the changes that have been investigated relative to changes in cable material
and in stowage and deployment hardware have indicated only minimal improvement in deployed
cable form, together with a weight penalty for the change. No hardware changes are
planned.

Mating of remote control unit to portable life support system. - During preparation
for extravehicular activity, the crew experienced considerable difficulty in mating the
electrical connectors from the remote control unit to the portable life support system.
For rotational polarization alinement, it was necessary to grasp the cable insulation
because the coupling lock ring was free for unlimited rotation on the connector shell
(fig. 16-24).

provisions, made closing of the containers
very difficult.
Because of the type of container seal, the force required to close the cover
reduces with each closure. The crew had extensive training with a sample return con-
tainer which had been opened and closed many times, resulting in closing forces lower
than the maximum limit of 32 pounds.
The container used for the flight had not been exercised, as had the container used
for training. In addition, the cleaning procedures used by the contractor before delivery
removed all lubricant from the latch linkage sliding surfaces. Tests with similar con-
tainers have shown that the cleaning procedure caused an increase in the closing force
of as much as 24 pounds.
A technique for burnishing on the lubricant after cleaning has been incorporated.
As a result, containers now being delivered require closing forces no greater than
25 pounds. Overcenter locking mechanisms for retaining the containers on the work table
will be installed on a mockup table and will be evaluated for possible incorporation on
Apollo 13 and subsequent missions.

17. CONCLUSIONS
The Apollo 11 mission, which included a manned lunar landing and lunar surface ex-
ploration, was conducted with skill, precision, and relative ease. The excellent per-
formance of the spacecraft in the preceding four flights and the thorough planning in all
aspects of the program permitted the safe and efficient execution of this mission. The
following conclusions are drawn from the information contained in this report.
1. The effectiveness of preflight training was reflected in the skill and precision
with which the crew executed the lunar landing. Manual control while maneuvering to the
desired landing point was satisfactorily exercised.
2. The planned techniques involved in the guidance, navigation, and control of the
descent trajectory were good. Performance of the landing radar met all expectations in
providing the information required for descent.
3. The extravehicular mobility units were adequately designed to enable the crew
to conduct the planned activities. Adaptation to the 1/6-g environment was relatively
quick, and mobility on the lunar surface was easy.
4. The two-man prelaunch checkout and countdown for ascent from the lunar surface
were well planned and executed.
5. The time-line activities for all phases of the lunar landing mission were well
within the crew's capability to perform the required tasks.
6. The quarantine operation from spacecraft landing until release of the crew,
spacecraft, and lunar samples from the Lunar Receiving Laboratory was accomplished suc-
cessfully and without any violation of the quarantine.
7. No micro-organisms from an extraterrestrial source were recovered from either
the crew or the spacecraft.
8. The hardware problems experienced on the Apollo 11 mission, as on previous
manned missions, were of a nature that did not unduly hamper the crew or result in the
compromise of safety or mission objectives.
9. The Mission Control Center and the Manned Space Flight Network proved to be
adequate for controlling and monitoring all phases of the flight, including the descent,
surface activity, and ascent phases of the mission.

VEHICLE DESCRIPTIONS
The Apollo 11 space vehicle contained few changes from the Apollo 10 configuration.
The launch escape system and the spacecraft/launch vehicle adapter were identical to
those for Apollo 10. The few minor changes to the command and service modules, the lunar
module, and the Saturn V launch vehicle are discussed in the following paragraphs. A
description of the extravehicular mobility unit and the lunar surface experiment equip-
ment and a listing of spacecraft mass properties are also presented.
Command and Service Modules
The insulation in the area of the command module forward hatch was modified to pre-
vent the flaking which occurred during the Apollo 10 lunar module pressurization. The
feedback circuit in the high-gain antenna was slightly changed to reduce servo dither.
In the Apollo 10 command module, one of the three entry batteries was modified to make
use of cellophane separators. The flight results proved this cellophane separator to
be superior to the Permion-type separators previously used, and the Apollo 11 command
module had the cellophane separators on all three entry batteries. The battery chargers
were modified to produce a higher charging capacity. The secondary bypass valves for the
fuel cell coolant loop were changed from an angle-cone seat design (block II) to a single-
angle seat design (block I) to reduce the possibility of particulate contamination. As
a replacement for the water/gas separation bag, which proved ineffective during Apollo 10,
an in-line dual-membrane separation device was added to both the water gun and the food
preparation unit.
Lunar Module
Structural changes.- The most significant structural change to the lunar module was
the added provisions for the functional early Apollo scientific experiments package and
the modular equipment stowage assembly, both of which housed the experiments and tools
used during the lunar surface activities. Another change was the addition of the reaction
control system plume deflectors.
Changes to the landing gear included (1) removing the lunar surface sensing probe
on the plus Z gear and lengthening the remaining probes and (2) increasing the sliding
clearance of the landing gear struts to permit full stroke at extreme temperature
conditions.
Thermal changes.- A change from Kapton to Kel-F was made to the descent stage base
heat shield to preclude the possibility of interference with the landing radar. Also,
insulation was added to the landing gear and the probes to accommodate the requirement
for descent engine firing until touchdown.
Communications systems changes.- The major modifications to the communications sys-
tems included the addition of an extravehicular activity antenna to the lunar module for
lunar communications between the crew and the lunar module and the addition of an S-band
erectable antenna to the lunar module to permit communications through the lunar module
communications system (fig. 16-16) while the crew was on the surface. A television
camera similar to that used on the Apollo 9 mission was stowed in the descent stage to
provide television coverage of the lunar surface activities.
205

--- PAGE 218 ---
Guidance and control system changes. The major difference in the guidance and con-
trol system was the redesign of the gimbal drive actuator to a constant damping system
rather than a brake. The actuator was redesigned as a result of the brake failing in
both the disengaged and the engaged positions. This change also required modification of
the descent engine control assembly and the phase-correcting network to eliminate the
possibility of inadvertent caution and warning alarms. The exterior tracking light had
improvements in the flash head and in the pulse-forming network. The pushbuttons for the
data entry and display assembly were rewired to preclude the erroneous caution and warn-
ing alarms that occurred on the Apollo 10 flight. The guidance and navigation optics
system was modified by the addition of Teflon locking rings to the sextant and to the
scanning telescope to prevent the rotation of eye guards under zero-g conditions. The
deletion of unmanned control capability permitted removal of the ascent engine aiming
assembly.
Ascent propulsion system changes.- The injector filter for the ascent propulsion
system was modified because the fine mesh in the original filter caused a change in the
mixture ratio. An additional change was the incorporation of a lightweight thrust
chamber.
Environmental control system changes.- In the environmental control system, a suit
cooling assembly and water hose umbilicals were added to the air revitalization section
to provide additional crew cooling capability. As a result, the cabin air recirculation
assembly, the cabin temperature control valve, and the regenerative heat exchanger were
deleted. Also, a redundant water regulator was added to the secondary coolant loop in
the water management section. In the environmental control system relay box in the oxy-
gen and cabin pressure control section, a pressure transducer was replaced by a suit
pressure switch to improve reliability.
Radar changes. The landing-radar electronics assembly was reconfigured to protect
against a computer strobing pulse that was providing what appeared to be two pulses to
the radar. Another modification permitted the crew to break tracker lock and to start a
search for the main beam in the event the radar pulse locked onto the structure or onto
a side lobe. The lunar reflectivity attenuation characteristics were updated in the radar
electronics to account for the updated Surveyor data and for landing-radar flight tests.
For correlation between the Manned Space Flight Network and the inertial measurement unit
of the primary guidance system, a logic change permitted the lateral velocity to be an
output signal of the landing radar. A further design change was made to prevent the land-
ing radar from accepting noise spikes as a pulse in the velocity bias error signal train.
The rendezvous-radar design changes included a new self-test segment to provide low-
temperature stability with the low-frequency and mid-frequency composite signal. In
addition, heaters were added to the gyro assembly and the cable wrap to accommodate the
lunar-stay temperature requirements. A manual voting override switch permitted the crew
to select either the primary or the secondary gyro inputs.
Display and control changes.- A circuit breaker was added for the abort electronics
assembly to protect the dc bus, and another circuit breaker was added to accommodate the
transfer of the utility light to the dc bus to provide redundant light.
The circuit breaker for the environmental control system suit and cabin repressuriza-
tion function was deleted in conjunction with the modification of the suit cooling assem-
bly. In addition, a low level caution and warning indication on the secondary water/
glycol accumulator has been provided.
Changes to the caution and warning electronics assembly included the inhibition of
the landing-radar temperature alarm and the prevention of a master alarm during inverter
selection and master alarm switching.
206

--- PAGE 219 ---
Master alarm functions which were eliminated include the descent helium regulator
warning prior to pressurization with the descent engine control assembly; the reaction-
control-system thrust-chamber-assembly warning with quad circuit breakers open; the
rendezvous-radar caution when the mode select switch is placed in the AUTO-TRACK posi-
tion; and the reaction-control-system quad temperature alarm. Caution and warning
functions which were deleted include the landing-radar velocity "data no good" warning
and the descent propellant low-level quantity warning, which was changed to a low-level
quantity indication light only.
A further change included the added capability of resetting the abort electronics
assembly caution and warning channel with the water quantity test switch. A modifica-
tion was made to the engine-stop-switch latching mechanism to ensure positive latching
of the switch.
Crew provision changes. The waste management system was changed to a one-large
and five-small urine container configuration. Additional stowage included provisions
for a second Hasselblad camera, for two portable life support systems and remote control
units, for two pairs of lunar overshoes, and for a feedwater collection bag. The Com-
mander had an attitude-controller-assembly lock mechanism added.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit
The extravehicular mobility unit provides life support in a pressurized or unpres-
surized cabin and up to 4 hours of extravehicular activity life support.
In its extravehicular configuration, the extravehicular mobility unit was a closed-
circuit pressure vessel that enveloped the crewman. The environment inside the pressure
vessel consisted of 100-percent oxygen at a nominal pressure of 3.75 psia. The oxygen
was provided at a flow rate of 6 cubic feet per minute. The extravehicular life support
equipment configuration is shown in figure B-1.
Liquid cooling garment.- The crewmen wore the liquid cooling garment while in the
lunar module and during all extravehicular activity. The garment provided cooling during
extravehicular and intravehicular activity by absorbing body heat and by transferring
excessive heat to the sublimator in the portable life support system. The liquid cooling
garment was a one-piece, long-sleeved, integrated stocking undergarment of netting mate-
rial. It consisted of an inner liner of nylon chiffon to facilitate donning and an outer
layer of nylon Spandex into which a network of Tygon tubing was woven. Cooled water,
supplied from the portable life support system or from the environmental control system,
was pumped through the tubing.
Pressure garment assembly.- The pressure garment assembly was the basic pressure
vessel of the extravehicular mobility unit. This assembly would have provided a mobile
life support chamber if cabin pressure had been lost because of leaks or puncture of the
vehicle. The pressure garment assembly consisted of a helmet, a torso and limb suit,
intravehicular activity gloves, and various controls and instrumentation to provide the
crewman with a controlled environment.
Torso and limb suit.- The torso and limb suit was a flexible pressure garment that
encompassed the entire body except the head and hands. It had four gas connectors, a
multiple water receptacle, and electrical connector, and a urine transfer connector.
The connectors had positive locking devices and could be connected and disconnected
without assistance from another crewman. The gas connectors comprised an oxygen inlet
and outlet connector on each side of the suit front torso. Each oxygen inlet connector
had an integral ventilation diverter valve. The multiple water receptacle, mounted on
the suit torso, served as the interface between the environmental control system water
207

--- PAGE 220 ---
supply and the water connectors for the liquid cooling garment and the portable life
support system. The electrical connector, when mated with the vehicle or with the
electrical umbilical of the portable life support system, provided a communications,
instrumentation, and power interface to the pressure garment assembly. The urine
transfer connector was used to transfer urine from the urine collection transfer
assembly to the waste management system.
The urine transfer connector on the suit right leg permitted dumping of the urine
collection bag without depressurizing the pressure garment assembly. A pressure relief
valve on the suit sleeve, near the wrist ring, vented the suit in the event of overpres-
surization. The valve opened at approximately 4.6 psig and reseated at 4.3 psig. If the
valve did not open, it could have been manually overridden. A pressure gage on the other
sleeve indicated suit pressure.
Helmet. - The helmet was a Lexan (polycarbonate) shell with a bubble-type visor, a
vent pad assembly, and a helmet-attaching ring. The vent pad assembly permitted a con-
stant flow of oxygen over the inner front surface of the helmet. The helmet did not turn
independently of the torso and limb suit; however, the crewman could turn his head within
the helmet neck-ring area. The helmet had provisions on each side for mounting an extra-
vehicular visor assembly.
Communications carrier. The communications carrier was a polyurethane foam headpiece
with two independent earphones and microphones which were connected to the suit 21-pin
communications electrical connector. The communications carrier could be worn with or
without the helmet during intravehicular operations. It was worn with the helmet during
extravehicular operations.
Integrated thermal micrometeoroid garment. - The integrated thermal micrometeoroid
garment, which was worn over the pressure garment assembly, protected the crewman from
harmful radiation, heat transfer, and micrometeoroid activity. The integrated thermal
micrometeoroid garment was a one-piece, form-fitting multilayered garment that was laced
over the pressure garment assembly and remained with it. The extravehicular activity
visor assembly, gloves, and boots were donned separately. From the outer layer in, the
integrated thermal micrometeoroid garment consisted of a protective cover, a
micrometeoroid-shielding layer, a thermal-barrier blanket (multiple layers of aluminized
Mylar), and a protective liner. A zipper on the integrated thermal micrometeoroid gar-
ment permitted connection or disconnection of umbilical hoses. For extravehicular activ-
ity, the pressure garment assembly gloves were replaced with the extravehicular activity
gloves. The extravehicular activity gloves were made of the same material as the integra-
ted thermal micrometeoroid garment to permit handling of intensely hot or cold objects
outside the cabin and for protection against lunar temperatures. The extravehicular ac-
tivity boots were worn over the pressure garment assembly boots. They were made of the
same material as the integrated thermal micrometeoroid garment. The soles had additional
insulation for protection against intense temperatures.
Extravehicular activity visor assembly. The extravehicular activity visor assembly
provided protection against solar heat, space particles, and radiation and helped to
maintain thermal balance. The two pivotal visors of the extravehicular activity visor
assembly could be attached to a pivot mounting on the pressure garment assembly helmet.
The lightly tinted (inner) visor reduced fogging in the helmet. The outer visor had a
vacuum-deposited gold-film reflective surface, which provided protection against solar
radiation and space particles. The extravehicular activity visor assembly was held snug
to the pressure garment assembly helmet by a tab-and-strap arrangement that allowed the
visors to be rotated approximately 90° up or down, as desired.
208

--- PAGE 221 ---
Portable life support system.- The portable life support system (fig. B-2) contained
the expendable materials and the communications and telemetry equipment required for
extravehicular operation. The system supplied oxygen to the pressure garment assembly
and cooling water to the liquid cooling garment and removed solid and gas contaminants
from returning oxygen. The suited crewman wore the portable life support system, attached
with a harness, on his back. The total system contained an oxygen ventilating circuit,
water feed and liquid transport loops, a primary oxygen supply, a main power supply,
communications systems, displays and related sensors, switches, and controls. A cover
encompassed the assembled unit, and the top of the portable life support system supported
the oxygen purge system.
Remote control unit.- The remote control unit was a display and control unit, chest-
mounted for easy access. The controls and displays consisted of a fan switch, pump
switch, space-suit communication-mode switch, volume control, oxygen quantity indicator,
and oxygen purge system actuator.
Oxygen purge system.- The oxygen purge system provided oxygen and pressure control
for certain extravehicular emergencies and was mounted on top of the portable life support
system. The system was self-contained, independently powered, and nonrechargeable. It
was capable of 30 minutes of regulated (3.7 + 0.3 psid) oxygen flow at 8 1b/hr to prevent
excessive carbon dioxide buildup and to provide limited cooling. The system consisted of
two interconnected spherical 2-pound oxygen bottles, an automatic temperature control
module, a pressure regulator assembly, a battery, oxygen connectors, and the necessary
checkout instrumentation. The oxygen purge system provided the hard mount for the
vhf antenna.
Experiment Equipment
Solar wind composition.- The purpose of the solar wind composition experiment was to
determine the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases and other selected elements
present in the solar wind. This objective was to be accomplished by trapping particles of
the solar wind on a sheet of aluminum foil exposed on the lunar surface.
Physically, the experiment consisted of a metallic telescoping pole approximately
1.5 inches in diameter and approximately 16 inches in length when collapsed. When ex-
tended, the pole was approximately 5 feet long. In the stowed position, the foil was
enclosed in one end of the tubing and rolled up on a spring-driven roller. Only the foil
portion was recovered at the end of the lunar exposure period. The foil was rolled on
the spring-driven roller and stowed in the sample return container for return to earth.
Laser ranging retroreflector.- The laser ranging retroreflector experiment (fig. B-3)
was a retroreflector array of fused silica cubes. A folding support structure was used
for aiming and alining the array toward earth. The purpose of the experiment was to re-
flect laser ranging beams from earth to their point of origin for precise measurement of
earth-moon distances, the center of the lunar mass motion, and the lunar radius; for earth
geophysical information; and for development of space communication technology.
Earth stations that can beam lasers to the experiment include the McDonald Observatory
at Fort Davis, Texas; the Lick Observatory at Mount Hamilton, California; and the Catalina
Station of the University of Arizona. Scientists in other countries also plan to bounce
laser beams off the retroreflector.
Passive seismic experiment package.- The passive seismic experiment (fig. B-4) con-
sisted of three long-period seismometers and one short-period vertical seismometer for
measuring meteoroid impacts and moonquakes and for gathering information on the lunar
interior (for example, whether a lunar core and mantle exist). The passive seismic ex-
periment package had four basic subsystems: the structure/thermal subsystem to provide
209

--- PAGE 222 ---
shock, vibration, and thermal protection; the electrical power subsystem to generate
34 to 46 watts by solar panel array; the data subsystem to receive and decode Manned
Space Flight Network up-link commands and down-link experiment data and to handle power
switching tasks; and the passive seismic experiment subsystem to measure lunar seismic
activity with long-period and short-period seismometers which could detect inertial mass
displacement. Also included in the package were 15-watt radioisotope heaters to maintain
the electronic package at a mimimum of 60° F during the lunar night.
A solar panel array of 2520 solar cells provided approximately 40 watts to operate
the instrument and the electronic components, including the telemetry data subsystem.
Scientific and engineering data were to be telemetered down link while ground commands
initiated from the Mission Control Center at the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center were to
be transmitted up link by using Manned Space Flight Network remote sites.
Lunar field geology.- The primary aim of the Apollo lunar field geology experiment
was to collect lunar samples. The tools described in the following paragraphs and shown
in figure B-5 were provided for this purpose.
A calibrated Hasselblad camera and a gnomon were to be used to obtain the geometric
data required to reconstruct the geology of the site in the form of geologic maps and to
recover the orientation of the samples for erosion and radiation studies. The sample
bags and camera frame numbers were provided to aid in identifying the samples and relat-
ing them to the crew's description.
Core tubes, in conjunction with hammers, were to provide samples in which the stra-
tigraphy of the uppermost portion of the regolith would be preserved for return to earth.
A sample scoop was provided for collecting particulate material and individual rock frag-
ments and for digging shallow trenches for inspection of the regolith. The tongs were
provided for collecting rock fragments and for retrieving tools that might have been
dropped. Lunar environment and gas analysis samples were to be collected, sealed in
special containers, and returned for analysis.
Launch Vehicle
Launch vehicle AS-506 was the sixth in the Apollo-Saturn V series and was the fourth
manned Apollo-Saturn V vehicle. The AS-506 launch vehicle was configured the same as the
AS-505 launch vehicle used for the Apollo 10 mission, except for the differences described
in the following paragraphs.
In the S-IC stage, the prevalve accumulator bottles were removed from the control
pressure system, and various components of the research and development instrumentation
system were removed or modified. In the S-II stage, the components of the research and
development instrumentation system were removed, and excess weld doublers were removed
from the liquid-oxygen-tank aft bulkhead.
In the S-IVB stage, five additional measurements were used to define the low-frequency
vibration that had occurred during the Apollo 10 mission. In the propulsion system, a
liner was added to the liquid hydrogen feed duct, an oxygen/hydrogen injector was changed,
the shutoff valve on the pneumatic power control module was modified by the addition of a
block point, and a new configuration of the cold helium shutoff and dump valves and a
pneumatic shutoff valve solenoid were installed.
In the instrument unit, the FM/FM telemetry system was modified to accommodate the
five added S-IVB structural vibration measurements. Tee sections, clamps, and thermal
switch settings were minor modifications in the environmental control system. The flight
program was changed to accommodate the requirements of the Apollo 11 mission.

Mass Properties
Spacecraft mass properties for the Apollo 11 mission are summarized in table B-I.
These data represent the conditions as determined from postflight analyses of expendable
loadings and usage during the flight. Variations in spacecraft mass properties are de-
termined for each significant mission phase from lift-off through landing. Expendables
usage is based on reported real-time and postflight data, as presented in other sections
of this report. The weights and centers of gravity of the individual command and service
modules and of the lunar module ascent and descent stages were measured prior to flight,
and the inertial values were calculated. All changes incorporated after the actual weigh-
ing were monitored, and the spacecraft mass properties were updated.
