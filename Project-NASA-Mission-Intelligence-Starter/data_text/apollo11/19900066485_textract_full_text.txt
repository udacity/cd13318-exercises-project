ABSTRACT
Saturn V AS-506 (Apollo 11 Mission) was launched at 09:32:00 Eastern
Daylight Time on July 16, 1969, from Kennedy Space Center, Complex 39,
Pad A. The vehicle lifted off on schedule on a launch azimuth of 90
degrees east of north and rolled to a flight azimuth of 72.058 degrees
east of north.
The launch vehicle successfully placed the manned spacecraft in the
planned translunar injection coast mode. The S-IVB/IU was placed in a
solar orbit with a period of 342 days by a combination of continuous
LH₂ vent, a LOX dump and APS ullage burn.
The Principal and Secondary Detailed Objectives of this mission
were completely accomplished. No failures, anomalies, or deviations
occurred that seriously affected the flight or mission.
Any questions or comments pertaining to the information contained in
this report are invited and should be directed to:
Director, George C. Marshall Space Flight Center
Huntsville, Alabama 35812
Attention: Chairman, Saturn Flight Evaluation Working
Group, S&E-CSE-LE (Phone 453-2575)

MISSION PLAN
The AS-506 flight (Apollo 11 Mission) is the sixth flight of the Apollo/
Saturn V flight test program. The primary objective of the mission is
to land astronauts on the lunar surface and return them safely to earth.
The crew consists of Neil Armstrong (Mission Commander), Lt. Col. Michael
Collins (Command Module Pilot), and Lt. Col. Edwin Aldrin, Jr. (Lunar
Module Pilot).
The AS-506 flight vehicle is composed of the S-IC-6, S-II-6, and S-IVB-6N
stages; Instrument Unit (IU)-6; Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)-14;
and Spacecraft (SC). The SC consists of Command and Service Module (CSM)
-107 and Lunar Module (LM)-5.
Vehicle launch from Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is along a
90 degree azimuth with a roll to a variable flight azimuth of 72 to 108
degrees measured east of true north. Vehicle mass at S-IC ignition is
2,941,221 kilograms (6,484,282 1bm). The S-IC stage powered flight is
approximately 161 seconds; the S-II stage provides powered flight for
approximately 389 seconds. Following S-IVB first burn (approximately
144 seconds duration), the S-IVB/IU/SLA/LM/CSM is inserted into a 183.8
by 186.5 kilometer (99.2 by 100.7 n mi) altitude (referenced to a spherical
earth) Earth Parking Orbit (EPO). Vehicle mass at orbit insertion is
135,669 kilograms (229,099 1bm).
At approximately 10 seconds after EPO insertion, the vehicle is aligned
with the local horizontal. Continuous hydrogen venting is initiated
shortly after EPO insertion and the Launch Vehicle (LV) and CSM systems are
checked in preparation for the Translunar Injection (TLI) burn. During the
second or third revolution in EPO, the S-IVB stage is reignited and burns
for approximately 349 seconds. This burn injects the S-IVB/IU/SLA/LM/CSM
into a free-return, translunar trajectory.
Approximately 15 minutes after TLI, the vehicle initiates an inertial
attitude hold for CSM separation, docking and LM ejection. Following the
attitude freeze, the CSM separates from the LV and the SLA panels are
jettisoned. The CSM then transposes and docks to the LM. After docking,
the CSM/LM is spring ejected from the S-IVB/IU. Following CSM/LM ejection,
the S-IVB/IU configuration achieves a co-rotational slingshot trajectory
by using propulsive venting of hydrogen (LH₂), dumping of oxygen (LOX) and
by firing the Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) ullage engines. The
slingshot trajectory results in a solar orbit for the S-IVB/IU.
xxiii

--- PAGE 30 ---
During the 3 day translunar coast, the astronauts perform star-earth
landmark sightings, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) alignments, general
lunar navigation procedures and possibly four midcourse corrections. At
approximately 76 hours, a Service Propulsion System (SPS), Lunar Orbit
Insertion (LOI) burn of approximately 359 seconds inserts the CSM/LM into
a 111 by 315 kilometer (60 by 170 n mi) altitude parking orbit.
After two revolutions in lunar orbit, a 16-second SPS burn circularizes
the orbit to 111 kilometers (60 n mi) altitude at 80 hours. The LM is
entered by astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin and checkout is accomplished.
During the eleventh revolution in orbit at 100 hours, the LM separates
from the CSM and prepares for the lunar descent. The LM descent propul-
sion system is used to brake the LM into the landing trajectory, approach
the landing site and perform the landing at 103 hours.
Following lunar landing, the two astronauts execute a 2.66 hour simulta-
neous lunar Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). After the EVA, the astronauts
prepare the ascent propulsion system for lunar ascent. The total lunar
stay time for Apollo 11 is approximately 22 hours.
The CSM performs a plane change approximately 17 hours prior to lunar
ascent. At approximately 124.5 hours, the ascent stage inserts the LM
into a 16.7 by 83.3 kilometer (9 by 45 n mi) altitude lunar orbit, and
rendezvous and docks with the CSM. The astronauts reenter the CSM,
jettison the LM and prepare for Transearth Injection (TEI). TEI is
accomplished at approximately 135 hours with a 149-second SPS burn. The
time and duration of the SPS TEI burn is dependent on an optional astro-
naut rest period.
During the 60-hour transearth coast, the astronauts perform navigation
procedures, star-earth-moon sightings and possibly three midcourse correc-
tions. The Service Module (SM) separates from the Command Module (CM) 15
minutes prior to reentry. Splashdown occurs in the Pacific Ocean approxi-
mately 195 hours after liftoff.
After the recovery operations, a biological quarantine is imposed on the
crew and CM. An incubation period of 18 days from splashdown (21 days
from lunar ascent) is required for the astronauts. The hardware incuba-
tion period is the time required to analyze certain lunar samples.

FLIGHT TEST SUMMARY
The fourth manned Saturn V Apollo space vehicle, AS-506 (Apollo 11
(Mission) was launched at 09:32:00 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 16,
1969 from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Complex 39, Pad A. This sixth
launch of the Saturn V/Apollo successfully performed the three principal
detailed objectives mandatory for successful accomplishment of the pri-
mary mission objective which was to perform a lunar landing and return.
The secondary detailed objective was also successfully accomplished.
The launch countdown was completed without any unscheduled countdown
holds. Ground system performance was satisfactory. Damage to the pad,
Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) and support equipment was minor.
The trajectory parameters of AS-506 from launch to Translunar Injection
(TLI) were close to nominal. The vehicle was launched on an azimuth 90
degrees east of north. A roll maneuver was initiated at 13.2 seconds
that placed the vehicle on a flight azimuth of 72.058 degrees east of
north. The space-fixed velocity at S-IC Outboard Engine Cutoff (OECO)
was 8.5 m/s (27.9 ft/s) greater than nominal. The space-fixed velocity
at S-II OECO was 22.8 m/s (74.8 ft/s) less than nominal. The space-fixed
velocity at S-IVB first guidance cutoff was 0.2 m/s (0.6 ft/s) less than
nominal. The altitude at S-IVB first guidance cutoff was 0.2 kilometer
(0.1 n mi) lower than nominal and the surface range was 1.7 kilometer
(1.0 n mi) less than nominal. The space-fixed velocity at parking orbit
insertion was equal to nominal. The apogee and perigee were 0.5 kilo-
meter (0.3 n mi) and 0.6 kilometer (0.3 n mi) less than nominal, respec-
tively. The parameters at TLI were also close to nominal. The space-
fixed velocity was 3.2 m/s (10.5 ft/s) greater than nominal, the altitude
was 3.1 kilometers (1.6 n mi) less than nominal and C₃ was 16,877 m2/s2
(181,663 ft2/s2) greater than nominal. Following Lunar Module (LM) extrac-
tion, the vehicle maneuvered to a slingshot attitude frozen relative to
local horizontal. The retrograde velocity change necessary to achieve
S-IVB/IU lunar slingshot maneuver was accomplished by a LOX dump, Auxiliary
Propulsion System (APS) burn, and LH₂ vent. The S-IVB/IU closest approach
of 3379 kilometers (1825 n mi) above the lunar surface occurred at 78.7
hours into the mission.
All S-IC propulsion systems performed satisfactorily and the propulsion
performance level was very close to nominal. Stage site thrust (averaged
from liftoff to OECO) was 0.62 percent lower than predicted. Total pro-
pellant consumption rate was 0.40 percent lower than predicted with the
total consumed Mixture Ratio (MR) 0.10 percent lower than predicted.
XXV

--- PAGE 32 ---
Specific impulse was 0.16 percent lower than predicted. Total propellant
consumption from Holddown Arm (HDA) release to OECO was low by 1.12 per-
cent. Center Engine Cutoff (CECO) was commanded by the IU as planned.
OECO, initiated by the LOX low level sensors, occurred 0.55 second later
than predicted.
The S-II propulsion system performed satisfactorily throughout the flight.
The S-II stage operation time of 385.18 seconds was 4.0 seconds shorter
than predicted. Early CECO successfully avoided high amplitude low fre-
quency oscillations experienced on the AS-503 and AS-504 flights. Total
stage thrust at 61 seconds after S-II Engine Start Command (ESC) was 0.20
percent below predicted. Total propellant flowrate (including pressuri-
zation flow) was 0.13 percent below predicted and vehicle specific impulse
was 0.07 percent below predicted at this time slice. Stage propellant MR
was 0.36 percent above predicted. The engine servicing system Ground
Support Equipment (GSE) performed satisfactorily except that the engine
No. 1 start tank pressure was 2.8 N/cm2 (4 psi) below redline at pre-
launch commit (-33 seconds). All start tank pressures and temperatures
were well within requirements at S-II ESC.
The J-2 engine operated satisfactorily throughout the operational phase
of S-IVB first and second burn. Shutdowns for both burns were normal.
S-IVB first burn duration was 147.1 seconds which was 3.4 seconds more
than predicted. The engine performance during first burn, as determined
from standard altitude reconstruction analysis, deviated from the pre-
dicted by +0.20 percent for thrust and +0.05 percent for specific impulse.
The S-IVB stage first burn Engine Cutoff (ECO) was initiated by the Launch
Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) at 699.34 seconds. The Continuous Vent
System (CVS) adequately regulated LH₂ tank ullage pressure during orbit,
and the Oxygen/Hydrogen (0₂/H₂) burner satisfactorily achieved LH₂ and
LOX tank repressurization for restart. Engine restart conditions were
within specified limits. The restart at full open Propellant Utilization
(PU) valve position was successful. S-IVB second burn duration was 346.9
seconds which was 1.7 seconds less than predicted. The engine perform-
ance during second burn, as determined from the standard altitude recon-
struction analysis, deviated from the predicted by -0.56 percent for
thrust and +0.05 percent for specific impulse. Subsequent to second
burn, the stage propellant tanks were safed satisfactorily.
The stage hydraulic systems performed satisfactorily on the S-IC, S-II,
and first burn and coast phase of the S-IVB stage. During this period
all parameters were within specification limits. Just after stage reigni-
tion the S-IVB hydraulic system pressure exceeded the upper limit by
0.6 percent. At 202 seconds into the burn, a step decrease in system
pressure to a nominal operating level occurred and the pressure remained
at this level for the remainder of the burn. The pump manufacturer does
not consider this condition to indicate impending malfunction of the
engine driven pump.

--- PAGE 33 ---
The structural loads and dynamic environments experienced by the AS-506
launch vehicle were well within the vehicle structural capability. The
longitudinal loads experienced during flight were nominal. The maximum
bending moment condition, 3.75 X 10⁶ N-m (33.2 X 106 lbf-in.), was ex-
perienced at 91.5 seconds and was lower than that experienced on any
previous flight. Low level first mode longitudinal oscillations similar
to those of previous flights were evident during each stage burn but
caused no problems.
The navigation and guidance system performed satisfactorily. The parking
orbit and TLI parameters were well within tolerance. The S-IVB LOX dump,
LH₂ vent and APS ullage burn resulted in a heliocentric orbit of the
S-IVB/IU as planned. The actual S-II Engine Mixture Ratio (EMR) shift
occurred approximately 9.5 seconds later than indicated by the final
stage propulsion prediction. About 4 seconds of this deviation was
attributed to the change in LVDC nominal characteristic velocity pre-
setting predictions and variation in actual from predicted flight per-
formance. Approximately 5.5 seconds of the deviation is attributed to
improper scaling in the flight program calculation of characteristic
velocity. The LVDC, the Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA), and the
ST-124M-3 inertial platform functioned satisfactorily. The platform-
measured crossrange velocity (γ) exhibited a negative shift of approxi-
mately 1.8 m/s (5.9 ft/s) at 3.3 seconds after liftoff. The probable
cause was the Y accelerometer head momentarily contacting an internal
mechanical stop. This had negligible effect on launch vehicle perform-
ance.
The AS-506 Flight Control Computer (FCC), Thrust Vector Control (TVC)
and APS satisfied all requirements for vehicle attitude control during
the flight. All maneuvers were properly accomplished. All separations
occurred as expected without producing significant attitude deviations.
The AS-506 launch vehicle electrical systems performed satisfactorily
throughout all phases of flight. Performance of the Secure Range Safety
Command Systems (SRSCS) was nominal on all powered stages. The SRSCS
was properly safed by ground command from Bermuda (BDA). Performance of
the Command and Communications System (CCS) was satisfactory except for
the Radio Frequency (RF) problem noted. The Emergency Detection System
(EDS) performance was nominal with no abort limits exceeded.
Vehicle base pressure environments were generally in good agreement with
postflight predictions and compared well with previous flight data.
There was no instrumentation provided on the AS-506 vehicle which would
permit a direct evaluation of the surface and compartment pressure en-
vironments. The one ambient pressure measurement located in the S-II
forward skirt was used to calculate the pressure loading acting on that
area, and indicated good agreement with postflight predictions and pre-
vious flight data.
xxvii

--- PAGE 34 ---
Base thermal environments were similar to those experienced on earlier
flights with the exception that S-II heat shield aft radiation heating
rates were approximately 20 percent higher than the maximum values mea-
sured during previous flights. Aerodynamic heating environments were
not measured on AS-506.
The Environmental Control System (ECS) performed satisfactorily. The
IU ECS coolant temperatures, pressure, and flowrates were continuously
maintained within required ranges and design limits. One deviation
from specification was observed. The inertial platform gas bearing
differential pressure drifted above the 10.7 N/cm2 (15.5 psid) maximum
to 11.2 N/cm2 (16.3 psid). This condition has occurred on previous
flights and caused no detrimental effect on the missions.
All elements of the data system performed satisfactorily except for a
problem with the CCS downlink during translunar coast. Measurement
performance was excellent as evidenced by 99.9 percent reliability.
This is the highest reliability attained on any Saturn V flight. Tele-
metry performance was nominal, with the exception of a minor calibra-
tion deviation. Very High Frequency (VHF) telemetry Radio Frequency
(RF) propagation was generally good, though the usual problems due to
flame effects and staging were experienced. VHF data were received to
17,800 seconds (04:56:40). Command systems RF performance for both
the SRSCS and CCS was nominal except for the CCS downlink problem
noted. Goldstone (GDS) reported receiving CCS signals to 35,779 seconds
(9:56:19). Good tracking data were received from the C-Band radar, with
Patrick Air Force Base (PAFB) indicating final LOS at 42,912 seconds
(11:55:12). The 75 ground engineering cameras provided good data during
the launch.

SECTION 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 PURPOSE
This report provides the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) Headquarters, and other interested agencies, with the launch vehicle
evaluation results of the AS-506 flight test. The basic objective of
flight evaluation is to acquire, reduce, analyze, evaluate and report on
flight test data to the extent required to assure future mission success
and vehicle reliability. To accomplish this objective, actual flight
failures, anomalies and deviations must be identified, their causes
accurately determined, and complete information made available so that
corrective action can be accomplished within the established flight
schedule.
1.2 SCOPE
This report presents the results of the early engineering flight evaluation
of the AS-506 launch vehicle. The contents are centered on the performance
evaluation of the major launch vehicle systems, with special emphasis on
the deviations. Summaries of launch operations and spacecraft performance
are included for completeness.
The official George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) position at
this time is represented by this report. It will not be followed by a
similar report unless continued analysis or new information should prove
the conclusions presented herein to be significantly incorrect. Final
stage evaluation reports will, however, be published by the stage
contractors. Reports covering major subjects and special subjects will be
published as required.

EVENT TIMES
2.1 SUMMARY OF EVENTS
Range zero time, the basic time reference for this report, is 9:32:00
Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) (13:32:00 Universal Time [UT]). This time
is based on the nearest second prior to S-IC tail plug disconnect which
occurred at 9:32:00.6 EDT. Range time is calculated as the elasped time
from range zero time and, unless otherwise noted, is the time used
throughout this report. The actual and predicted range times are ad-
justed to ground telemetry received times. The Time-From-Base times are
presented as vehicle times. Figure 2-1 shows the time delay of ground
telemetry received time versus Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) time
and indicates the magnitude and sign of corrections applied to correlate
range time and vehicle time in Tables 2-1, 2-2 and 2-3.
Guidance Reference Release (GRR) occurred at -16.97 seconds and start of
Time Base 1 (T7) occurred at 0.63 seconds. GRR was established by the
Digital Events Evaluator (DEE-6) and T₁ was initiated at detection of
liftoff signal provided by de-energizing the liftoff relay in the Instru-
ment Unit (IU) at IU umbilical disconnect.
Range time for each time base used in the flight sequence program and the
signal for initiating each time base are presented in Table 2-1.
Start of T₂ was within nominal expectations for this event. Start of T3,
T4 and T5 were initiated approximately 0.6 second late and 3.5 and 0.1
seconds early, respectively, due to variations in the stage burn times.
These variations are discussed in Sections 5, 6 and 7 of this document.
Start of T₆, which was initiated by the LVDC upon solving the restart
equation, was 0.9 second later than predicted. Start of T₇ was 1.0 second
earlier than predicted. T₈, which was initiated by the receipt of a
ground command, was started 63.2 seconds later than the predicted time.
A summary of significant events for AS-506 is given in Table 2-2. Since
not all events listed in Table 2-2 are IU commanded switch selector func-
tions, deviations are not to be construed as failures to meet specified
switch selector tolerances. The events in Table 2-2 associated with guid-
ance, navigation, and control have been identified as being accurate to
within a major computation cycle.

The predicted times for establishing actual minus predicted times in
Table 2-2 have been taken from 40M33626B, "Interface Control Document
Definition of Saturn SA-506 Flight Sequence Program", and from the
"AS-506 G Mission Launch Vehicle Operational Trajectory", dated July 14,
1969.
2.2 VARIABLE TIME AND COMMANDED SWITCH SELECTOR EVENTS
Table 2-3 lists the switch selector events which were issued during the
flight but were not programed for specific times. The range times are
adjusted to ground telemetry received times. The water coolant valve
open and close switch selector commands were issued based on the condition
of two thermal switches in the Environmental Control System (ECS). The
outputs of these switches were sampled once every 300 seconds, beginning
at 180 seconds, and a switch selector command was issued to open or close
the water valve. The valve was opened if the sensed temperature was too
high and the valve was closed if the temperature was too low.

SECTION 3
LAUNCH OPERATIONS
3.1 SUMMARY
The ground systems supporting the AS-506/Apollo 11 countdown and launch
performed exceptionally well. Several systems experienced component
failures and malfunctions which required corrective actions, but all re-
pairs were accomplished in parallel with the scheduled countdown opera-
tions. No unscheduled holds were incurred. Propellant tanking was
accomplished satisfactorily. The start of S-II LH₂ loading was delayed
25 minutes due to a communications problem in the Pad Terminal Connection
Room (PTCR). However, this delay time was recovered during the scheduled
hold at -3 hours 30 minutes. Launch occurred at 09:32:00 Eastern Daylight
Time (EDT), July 16, 1969, from Pad 39A of the Saturn Complex. Damage
to the pad, Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) and support equipment was minor.
3.2 PRELAUNCH MILESTONES
A chronological summary of events and preparations leading to the launch
of AS-506 is contained in Table 3-1.
3.3 COUNTDOWN EVENTS
The AS-506/Apollo 11 terminal countdown was picked up at -28 hours on
July 14, 1969 at 17:00:00 EDT. Scheduled holds of 11 hours duration at
-9 hours in the count, and 1 hour 32 minutes duration at -3 hours 30
minutes, were the only holds initiated. The start of S-II LH₂ loading
was delayed 25 minutes due to a communications problem in the PTCR. How-
ever, this time was recovered during the hold at -3 hours 30 minutes and
Space Vehicle (SV) activities were on schedule when the countdown re-
sumed. Launch occurred at 09:32:00 EDT, July 16, 1969, from Pad 39A of
the Saturn Complex.
3.4 PROPELLANT LOADING
3.4.1 RP-1 Loading
The RP-1 system supported the launch countdown satisfactorily. At approxi-
mately -21 hours the Propellant Tanking Control System (PTCS) RP-1 level
indication from the propellant monitor program display became erratic.
The problem was traced to a noisy RP-1 loading electronics unit. Since

the RP-1 level display was not a critical measurement, the disposition
of the electronics unit was "use as is". However, the level indication
was stable during the final 8 hours of countdown.
The RP-1 system vent trap closed prematurely during replenish operations
at -13 hours, causing entrapped air to be pumped through the S-IC fuel
tank. There were no serious consequences. The air, which is filtered
to about 50 microns, was immediately vented from the stage. All subse-
quent system functions were normal, and replenishment was completed
satisfactorily.
3.4.2 LOX Loading
The LOX system successfully supported the launch countdown. A premature
closure of the S-II stage LOX tank vents during slow fill to 99 percent
flight mass caused the LOX loading system to revert at about -6 hours
43 minutes. Recovery procedures were initiated, and flow was reestab-
lished at about -6 hours 35 minutes. Launch vehicle loading and replenish
operations were completed without further incident. A procedure change
will be made to prevent cycling of the tank vents prior to reaching the
99 percent value during future cryogenic loadings.
3.4.3 LH₂ Loading
The LH₂ system supported the launch countdown satisfactorily. A communi-
cations problem in the Radio Frequency-Operational Intercom System (RF-
OIS) caused a delay in the start of S-II LH₂ loading of 25 minutes. The
RF-OIS/Pad A fault summary light illuminated at the Launch Control Center
(LCC) during LOX loading. This condition could indicate, as a worse case,
that pad OIS had switched to batteries or less critical, that an OIS
amplifier had switched to secondary. Upon pad entry, an amplifier was
found to have automatically switched to secondary; it was reset manually
in the PTCR and the fault summary light in the LCC went off.
During LH₂ replenish operations at about -3 hours 20 minutes, a leak de-
veloped in the S-IVB stage replenish valve located on LUT level 200.
The LH₂ system was drained and purged, and the valve bonnet and packing
gland bolts were retorqued. No further leakage was detected when LH₂
loading operations were resumed at about -2 hours. However, to prevent
problem recurrence that could cause countdown delay, the replenish valve
was closed and subsequent S-IVB replenishment accomplished manually using
the main fill valve in the reduced position.
About 7 minutes after liftoff, during automatic line drain and purge
operations, the S-IC liftoff indication was lost causing an LH₂ system
revert. Drain and purge operations were completed manually using the
S-II/S-IVB fill line purge valve. Although this is not the normal manual
configuration, a satisfactory purge was obtained. A change in the pro-
pellant system logic is presently being considered which will isolate the
system from external influence once the liftoff signal is received.
3-3

--- PAGE 52 ---
3.4.4 Auxiliary Propulsion System Propellant Loading
Propellant loading of the S-IVB Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) was
accomplished satisfactorily. Total propellant mass in both modules at
liftoff was 184.3 kilograms (406 1bm) of Nitrogen Tetroxide (N₂0₄) and
114.4 kilograms (252 1bm) of Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH).
3.5 S-II INSULATION, PURGE AND LEAK DETECTION
The performance of the S-II stage insulation was highly satisfactory.
Detailed inspection of all external insulation was conducted by opera-
tional television during the countdown and no significant leakage was
detected. The total heat leakage through the insulation to the LH₂ was
within specification limits. Satisfactory pressures and flows were
maintained in all purge circuits during countdown. The leak detection
system performed satisfactorily throughout the final countdown and
contaminant gas concentrations remained within acceptable limits at
all times. There were no problems during countdown with the leak de-
tecting selector solenoid valve which presented a minor problem during
Countdown Demonstration Test (CDDT).
3.6 GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (GSE)
3.6.1 Ground/Vehicle Interface
Detailed discussion of the GSE will be contained in the Kennedy Space
Center Apollo/Saturn V (AS-506) Ground Systems Evaluation Reports. The
performance of all ground systems was highly satisfactory. Overall
damage to the pad, LUT and support equipment from the blast and flame
impingement was minor. The Holddown Arms (HDA), Tail Service Masts (TSM)
and Service Arms (SA) performed within design limits during the launch
sequence.
The HDA's were released pneumatically at 0.3 second. HDA No. 1 protective
hood did not close and the adjustable head and upper link received some
blast damage. However, damage to the interior of HDA No. 1 was not greater
than to any other arm. Warpage of the HDA protective hoods was negligible.
As on AS-504 launch, the secondary Service Arm Control Switch (SACS)
actuator arm on HDA No. 2 was broken off.
TSM retractions were normal and all protective hoods closed properly.
The RP-1 mast cutoff valve in TSM 1-2 opened at liftoff, indicating a
loss of valve GN₂ control pressure. The cause of pressure loss is being
investigated.
SA systems total retract times to safe angle were within specifications.
Damage to SA systems was slight. Control console door latches were bent
or broken on all SA levels of the LUT; however, provisions incorporated
for AS-506 - restrained the doors and prevented their blowing open as had
3-4

--- PAGE 53 ---
occurred on previous launches. Hydraulic oil leakage from SA No. 2
upper and lower hinge areas was detected during postlaunch inspection
and was observed to have leaked into SA No. 1. Investigation will be
conducted to determine the source.
None of the ground/vehicle related problems experienced during launch
preparations had sufficient impact such as to constrain the countdown
operations. All system repairs and remedial actions were accomplished
in parallel with countdown operations. At -13 hours 30 minutes, about
07:31:00 EDT on July 15, 1969, it was discovered that the LCC Data Trans-
mission System (DTS) would not synchronize with the DTS transmitter at
Pad A. Further investigation revealed severe attenuation of transmitted
data. The basic problem was traced to a discrepant patch in the wide-
band video distributor. Satisfactory operation was restored at about
19:00:00 EDT of the same day.
3.6.2 MSFC Furnished Ground Support Equipment
Performance of the mechanical and electrical equipment supporting the
launch operations was satisfactory. Blast damage to the equipment was
considered normal. Minor GSE deviations encountered were as follows:
a. SA No. 1 (S-IC Intertank) umbilical carrier withdrawal time was
approximately 0.06 second greater than the specification maximum
of 5 seconds. Withdrawal time for this carrier under non-cryogenic
conditions, based on the average of results obtained during system
revalidation testing, is approximately 3 seconds. Total SA No. 1
retract time to safe angle was 9.9 seconds, which is within the
specification limit of 10.5 seconds and was about 3.9 seconds be-
fore SA No. 2 retract command. (Failure to achieve SA No. 1 safe
angle prior to time for SA No. 2 retract at -16.2 seconds would
cause cutoff.) Cause of the slow withdrawal has not yet been de-
termined. Slower than specification withdrawal times were also
experienced during the AS-503 and AS-505 launch countdowns. The
withdrawal time for the AS-504 launch, although within specification
limits, was slower than the average obtained during validation test-
ing under non-cryogenic conditions. Investigation is continuing.
b. The GH₂ dome regulator in the S-II stage pneumatic servicing console
indicated erratic leakage during the -9 hour countdown hold and was
replaced with a spare regulator. The new regulator was not adjusted
to the high side tolerance of the 810 +10.3 N/cm2 (1175 +15 psia)
setting, as planned. During S-II start tank pressurization, the
low regulator setting resulted in the start tank pressures being
lower than the desired prelaunch values. At the prelaunch commit
point (-33 seconds), S-II Engine No. 1 start tank pressure was
2.8 N/cm2 (4 psi) below the redline requirement. The countdown was
continued since the Central Instrumentation Facility (CIF) observer
verified that the measurement was not below redline at -45 seconds.
3-5

--- PAGE 54 ---
The regulator pressures will be set to 827 +10.3 N/cm² (1200 +15 psia)
for subsequent vehicles and this will alleviate the prelaunch low
pressure conditions.
C.
The S-II LH₂ heat exchanger delta pressure controller mode of con-
trol did not operate properly and the point sensor mode of control
was initiated after the beginning of start tank chilldown. This
mode of operation was utilized throughout the remaining portion of
the countdown. Also, the heat exchanger would not refill properly
during the start tank and thrust chamber chilldown sequences. How-
ever, the liquid level was sufficient to perform the required stage
systems chilldown. The deviation will be investigated.
3.6.3 Camera Coverage
A total of 201 cameras were installed for the AS-506 launch of which 119
were committed to engineering data, and 82 to documentary coverage.
Three cameras failed to acquire data. Upon review of film coverage of
the GSE at launch, the following conditions were observed:
a.
S-II stage forward SA umbilical covers did not secure upon SA with-
drawal from the vehicle.
b.
HDA No. 1 protective hood failed to close and the other three HDA
hoods appeared to close late.

SECTION 4
TRAJECTORY
4.1 SUMMARY
The trajectory parameters from launch to Translunar Injection (TLI) were
close to nominal. The vehicle was launched on an azimuth 90 degrees east
of north. A roll maneuver was initiated at 13.2 seconds that placed the
vehicle on a flight azimuth of 72.058 degrees east of north.
The space-fixed velocity at S-IC Outboard Engine Cutoff (OECO) was 8.5 m/s
(27.9 ft/s) greater than nominal. The space-fixed velocity at S-II Out-
board Engine Cutoff was 22.8 m/s (74.8 ft/s) less than nominal. The
space-fixed velocity at S-IVB first guidance cutoff was 0.2 m/s (0.6 ft/s)
less than nominal. The altitude at S-IVB first guidance cutoff was 0.2
kilometer (0.1 n mi) lower than nominal and the surface range was 1.7
kilometers (1.0 n mi) less than nominal.
The space-fixed velocity at parking orbit insertion was equal to nominal
and the flight path angle was 0.013 degree greater than nominal. The
eccentricity was 0.00001 less than nominal. The apogee and perigee were
0.5 kilometer (0.3 n mi) and 0.6 kilometer (0.3 n mi) less than nominal,
respectively.
The parameters at translunar injection were also close to nominal. The
eccentricity was 0.00029 greater than nominal, the inclination was 0.004
degree greater than nominal, the node was 0.019 degree lower than nominal,
and C₃ was 16,877 m2/s2 (181,663 ft2/s2) greater than nominal. The space-
fixed velocity was 3.2 m/s (10.5 ft/s) greater than nominal and the alti-
tude was 3.1 kilometers (1.6 n mi) less than nominal.
Following Lunar Module (LM) extraction, the vehicle maneuvered to a
slingshot attitude frozen relátive to local horizontal. The retrograde
velocity to achieve S-IVB/IU lunar slingshot was accomplished by a LOX
dump, Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) burn, and LH₂ vent. The S-IVB/IU
closest approach of 3379 kilometers (1825 n mi) above the lunar surface
occurred at 78.7 hours into the mission.
The actual impact locations for the spent S-IC and S-II stages were de-
termined by a theoretical free-flight simulation. The surface range for
the S-IC impact point was 0.2 kilometer (0.1 n mi) greater than nominal.
The surface range for the S-II impact point was 91.7 kilometers (49.5 n mi)
less than nominal.

4.2 TRACKING DATA UTILIZATION
4.2.1 Tracking During the Ascent Phase of Flight
Tracking data were obtained during the period from the time of first
motion through parking orbit insertion.
The best estimate trajectory was established by using telemetered guidance
velocities as generating parameters to fit data from five different C-Band
tracking stations. Approximately 30 percent of the various tracking data
was eliminated due to inconsistencies. A comparison of the reconstructed
ascent trajectory with the remaining tracking data yielded good agreement.
The launch phase portion of the trajectory (liftoff to approximately 20
seconds) was established by constraining integrated telemetered guidance
accelerometer data to the early phase of the best estimate trajectory.
4.2.2 Tracking During the Parking Orbit Phase of Flight
Orbital tracking was conducted by the NASA Manned Space Flight Network
(MSFN). Eight C-Band radar stations furnished data for use in determining
the parking orbit trajectory. There were also considerable S-Band tracking
data available which were not used due to the abundance of C-Band radar
data.
The parking orbit trajectory was obtained by integrating corrected inser-
tion conditions forward to the S-IVB second burn restart preparation
event. The insertion conditions, as determined by the Orbital Correction
Program (OCP), were obtained by a differential correction procedure which
adjusted the estimated insertion conditions to fit the C-Band radar track-
ing data in accordance with the weights assigned to the data. After all
available C-Band radar tracking data were analyzed, the stations and
passes providing the better quality data were used in the determination
of the insertion conditions.
4.2.3 Tracking During the Injection Phase of Flight
C-Band radar data were obtained from the ship Redstone during the early
portion of the injection phase of flight. These tracking data were found
to be invalid and were not used in the trajectory determination.
The injection trajectory was established by integrating the telemetered
guidance velocity data forward from the restart vector at 9715 seconds
(obtained from the parking orbit trajectory) and constraining the end
point to the TLI vector at 10,213.03 seconds (obtained from the post TLI
trajectory).
4-2

--- PAGE 57 ---
4.2.4 Tracking During the Post Injection Phase of Flight
Tracking data from seven C-Band radar stations furnished data for use in
determining the post TLI trajectory. The available S-Band tracking data
were not used due to the availability of the C-Band radar data.
The post TLI trajectory was obtained by integrating corrected injection
conditions forward to S-IVB/Command and Service Module (CSM) separation.
The corrected injection conditions were determined by the same method
outlined in paragraph 4.2.2.
4.3 TRAJECTORY EVALUATION

The solutions that were considered reasonable had a spread of about +250
meters (+820 ft) in position components and +0.7 m/s (+2.3 ft/s) in velo-
city components. The actual and nominal parking orbit insertion parameters
are presented in Table 4-5. The ground track from insertion to S-IVB/CSM

the end of the time period.
The trajectory and targeting parameters at S-IVB second guidance cutoff
and TLI are presented in Tables 4-2 and 4-6, respectively.
4.3.4 Post TLI Trajectory
A family of values for the injection parameters was obtained depending on
the combination of data used and the weights applied to the data. The
solutions that were considered reasonable had a spread of about +500
meters (+1640 ft) in position components and +1.0 m/s (+3.3 ft/s) in
velocity components. A comparison of the actual and nominal S-IVB/CSM
separation conditions is presented in Table 4-3.

4.3.5 S-IVB/IU Post Separation Trajectory
After final LM separation, the S-IVB/IU was placed on a lunar slingshot
trajectory. This trajectory was accomplished by slowing down the S-IVB/IU
to make it pass by the trailing edge of the moon and obtain sufficient
energy to continue to a solar orbit. This was accomplished by a combina-
tion of 108-second LOX dump, 280-second APS burn, and LH₂ vent. A time
history of the velocity increase along the vehicle longitudinal axis for
the slingshot maneuver is presented in Figure 4-8. Table 4-7 presents a
comparison of the actual and nominal velocity increase due to the various

phases of the maneuver. The major error contribution in total velocity
increase is due to the resulting 7.3 m/s (24.0 ft/s) from the Continuous
Vent System (CVS) as compared to 3.5 m/s (11.5 ft/s) for the predicted
value. Figure 4-9 presents the resultant conditions for various velocity
increases at the given attitude of the vehicle for the maneuver.
The S-IVB/IU closest approach of 3379 kilometers (1825 n mi) above the
lunar surface occurred at 78.7 hours into the mission. The trajectory
parameters were obtained by integrating forward a vector (furnished by
Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) which was obtained from Unified S-Band
(USB) tracking data during the active lifetime of the S-IVB/IU. The actual
and nominal conditions at closest approach are presented in Table 4-8.
Figure 4-10 illustrates the influence of the moon on the S-IVB/IU energy
(velocity) relative to the earth, particularly as the spent stage passes
through the lunar sphere of influence. Some of the heliocentric orbit
parameters of the S-IVB/IU are presented in Table 4-9. The same para-
meters for the earths orbit are also presented for comparison.

SECTION 5
S-IC PROPULSION
5.1 SUMMARY
All S-IC propulsion systems performed satisfactorily and the propulsion
performance level was very close to nominal. Stage site thrust (averaged
from liftoff to Outboard Engine Cutoff [OECO]) was 0.62 percent lower than
predicted. Total propellant consumption rate was 0.40 percent lower than
predicted with the total consumed Mixture Ratio (MR) 0.10 percent lower
than predicted. Specific impulse was 0.16 percent lower than predicted.
Total propellant consumption from Holddown Arm (HDA) release to OECO was
low by 1.12 percent.
Center Engine Cutoff (CECO) was initiated by the Instrument Unit (IU) at
135.20 seconds as planned. OECO, initiated by LOX low level sensors,
occurred at 161.63 seconds which was 0.55 second later than predicted.
This is a small difference compared to the predicted 3-sigma limits
of +3.74 seconds. The LOX residual at OECO was 18,041 kilograms (39,772
1bm) compared to the predicted 18,177 kilograms (40,074 1bm). The fuel
residual at OECO was 13,954 kilograms (30,763 1bm) compared to the pre-
dicted 14,354 kilograms (31,645 1bm).
5.2 S-IC IGNITION TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE
The fuel pump inlet preignition pressure was 31.6 N/cm² (45.9 psia) and
within F-1 Engine Model Specification limits of 30.0 to 75.8 N/cm2 (43.5
to 110 psia). The fuel pump inlet preignition temperatures were not
available since these measurements were deleted from the S-IC-6 and
subsequent stages.
The LOX pump inlet preignition pressure and temperature were 58.5 N/cm²
(84.8 psia) and 96.1°K (-286.7°F) and were within the F-1 Engine Model
Specification limits as shown in Figure 5-1.
Engine startup sequence was nominal. A 1-2-2 start was planned and
attained. Engine position starting order was 5, 1-3, 4-2. Two engines
are considered to start together if their combustion chamber pressures
reach 68.9 N/cm2 (100 psig) in a 100-millisecond time period.

Figure 5-1. S-IC LOX Start Box Requirements
Figure 5-2 shows the thrust buildup of each engine indicative of the
successful 1-2-2 start. The shift in thrust buildup near the 5,250,000
Newtons (1,180,000 lbf) level on the outboard engines is caused by in-
gestion of helium from the LOX prevalves during startup. The thrust shift
is absent on the center engine since the POGO suppression helium accumula-
tor system is not used on this engine. Engine combustion chamber pressure
oscillograms show 79- to 80-hertz oscillations of approximately 445,000
Newtons (100,000 1bf) peak-to-peak amplitude during buildup. These OS-
cillations are characteristic of normal F-1 engine thrust buildup. Engines
No. 1 and 5 show normal inertial surge chamber pressure spikes of approxi-
mately 48.3 N/cm2 (70 psi) and 50.3 N/cm2 (73 psi), respectively, at 3.45
seconds after their individual start solenoids were energized. Engine
No. 4 data indicate a large chamber pressure spike (approximately 80 per-
cent of the mainstage level) at 3.42 seconds after engine No. 4 start
solenoid energization. The unusual magnitude of this spike is believed
to have been the result of a data, problem and is a characteristic of the
flight pressure transducer. Static firings of the F-1 engines have
exhibited similar pressure spikes (measured with the flight pressure
transducer) during the buildup transient, but failed to indicate the same

spike on high frequency type ground firing instrumentation. The pressure
spike has, therefore, been omitted from the thrust buildup curve shown
in Figure 5-2.
The best estimate of propellants consumed between ignition and HDA
release was 39,374 kilograms (86,803 1bm). The predicted consumption
was 38,913 kilograms (85,790 1bm). Propellant loads at HDA release were
1,468,594 kilograms (3,237,697 1bm) for LOX and 637,830 kilograms
(1,406,175 1bm) for fuel.
5.3 S-IC MAINSTAGE PERFORMANCE
S-IC stage propulsion performance was satisfactory. Site performance was
very close to the predicted level as can be seen in Figure 5-3. The stage
site thrust (averaged from liftoff to OECO) was 0.62 percent lower than
predicted with the total propellant consumption rate 0.40 percent lower
than predicted and the total consumed propellant MR 0.10 percent lower
than predicted and the specific impulse 0.16 percent lower than predicted.
Total propellant consumption from HDA release to OECO was low by 1.12
percent.
The F-1 engines performance levels during the AS-506 flight showed the
smallest deviations from predicted levels of any S-IC flight.

For comparing F-1 engine flight performance with predicted performance,
the flight performance has been analytically reduced to standard condi-
tions and compared to the predicted performance which is based on ground
firings and also reduced to standard conditions. These values are shown
in Table 5-1 at the 35- to 38-second time slice. Individual engine de-
viations from predicted thrust ranged from 0.662 percent lower (engine
No. 5) to 0.527 percent higher (engine No. 4). Individual engine devia-
tions from predicted specific impulse ranged from 0.114 percent lower
(engine No. 5) to 0.038 percent higher (engines No. 1 and 4).
5.4 S-IC ENGINE SHUTDOWN TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE
CECO was initiated by a signal from the IU at 135.20 seconds as planned.
OECO, initiated by LOX low level sensors, occurred at 161.63 seconds
which was 0.55 second later than predicted. This is a small difference
compared to the predicted 3-sigma limits of +3.74 seconds. Most of
the OECO deviation can be attributed to lower than predicted thrust,
specific impulse, and propellant loads.
Thrust decay of the F-1 engines was nominal.

Engine cutoff impulse was approximately 10,612,096 N-s (2,385,694 1bf-s)
or 11 percent higher than predicted for the outboard engines and approxi-
mately 2,659,605 N-s (597,903 lbf-s) or 7 percent lower than predicted
for the center engine. The impulse values stated for the outboard
engines are for the period from cutoff signal to stage separation, and
the impulse value for the center engine is for the period from cutoff
signal to zero thrust of the center engine. The flight cutoff impulse
is based on chamber pressures. At cutoff, chamber pressure was high for
engines No. 1, 3 and especially 4, and low for engine No. 5. These
chamber pressure deviations yielded sufficient thrust to account for the
cutoff impulse deviations.
5.5 S-IC STAGE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT
The S-IC does not have an active Propellant Utilization (PU) system.
Minimum residuals are obtained by attempting to load the mixture ratio
expected to be consumed by the engines plus the predicted unusable resi-
duals. An analysis of the usable residuals experienced during a flight
is a good measure of the performance of the passive PU system.
OECO was initiated by the LOX low level sensors as planned, and resulted
in residual propellants being very close to the predicted values. The
residual LOX at OECO was 18,041 kilograms (39,772 1bm) compared to the
predicted value of 18,177 kilograms (40,074 1bm). The fuel residual at
OECO was 13,954 kilograms (30,763 1bm) compared to the predicted value
of 14,354 kilograms (31,645 1bm). A summary of the propellants remaining
at major event times is presented in Table 5-2.

5.6 S-IC PRESSURIZATION SYSTEMS
5.6.1 S-IC Fuel Pressurization System
The fuel tank pressurization system performed satisfactorily keeping
ullage pressure within the acceptable limits during flight. Helium Flow
Control Valves (HFCV's) No. 1 through 4 opened as planned and HFCV No. 5
was not required.
The low flow prepressurization system was commanded on at -97 seconds.
High flow pressurization, accomplished by the onboard pressurization
system, performed as expected. HFCV No. 1 was commanded on at -2.7 seconds
and was supplemented by the high flow prepressurization system until um-
bilical disconnect.
Fuel tank ullage pressure was within the predicted limits throughout
flight as shown in Figure 5-4. HFCV's No. 2, 3, and 4 were commanded
open during flight by the switch selector within acceptable limits.
Helium bottle pressure was 2137 N/cm2 (3100 psia) at -2.8 seconds and
decayed to 331 N/cm2 (480 psia) at OECO. Total helium flowrate and heat
exchanger performance were as expected.
Fuel pump inlet pressure was maintained above the required minimum Net
Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP) during flight.
5.6.2 S-IC LOX Pressurization System
The LOX pressurization system performed satisfactorily and all performance
requirements were met. The ground prepressurization system maintained
ullage pressure within acceptable limits until launch commit. The on-
board pressurization system subsequently maintained ullage pressure within
the GOX Flow Control Valve (GFCV) band during flight.
The prepressurization system was initiated at -72 seconds. Ullage pres-
sure increased to the prepressurization switch band and flow was terminated
at -57 seconds. The low-flow system was cycled on two additional times
at -40 and -17 seconds. At -4.7 seconds the high-flow system was com-
manded on and maintained ullage pressure within acceptable limits until
launch commit.
The LOX tank ullage pressure during flight, shown in Figure 5-5, was main-
tained within the required limits throughout flight by the GFCV. The maxi-
mum GOX flowrate to the tank (at CECO) was 24.9 kg/s (55.0 1bm/s). The
heat exchangers performed as expected.
The LOX pump inlet pressure met the minimum NPSP requirement throughout
flight. The engine No. 5 LOX suction duct pressure decayed after CECO
similar to previous flights as shown in Figure 5-6. The cause of these
decays is still unknown.

5.7 S-IC PNEUMATIC CONTROL PRESSURE SYSTEM
The control pressure system functioned satisfactorily throughout the S-IC
flight.
Sphere pressure was 2151 N/cm² (3120 psia) at liftoff and remained steady
until CECO when it decreased to 2068 N/cm2 (3000 psia). The decrease was
due to center engine prevalve actuation. There was a further decrease to
1810 N/cm2 (2625 psia) after OECO.
The engine prevalves were closed after engine cutoff as required. The
engine No. 5 prevalves closed at approximately 137 seconds. The pre-
valves for the other four engines closed at approximately 163 seconds.
5.8 S-IC PURGE SYSTEMS
Performance of the S-IC purge systems was satisfactory during the flight.
The turbopump LOX seal purge storage sphere pressure was within the limits
of 1862 to 2275 N/cm2 (2700 to 3300 psia) until ignition and 2275 to 689
N/cm2 (3300 to 1000 psia) from liftoff to cutoff. The radiation calori-
meter purge system was not installed on S-IC-6 nor subsequent vehicles.

The POGO suppression system performed satisfactorily during S-IC flight.
Outboard LOX prevalve temperature measurements indicated that the prevalve
cavities were filled with helium prior to liftoff as planned. The mea-
surements in the outboard prevalves went cold momentarily at liftoff in-
dicating LOX sloshed on the probes. They remained warm throughout flight,
indicating helium in the prevalves. At cutoff, the increased pressure
forced LOX into the prevalves once more. The two measurements in the
center engine prevalve indicated cold, which meant LOX was in this valve,
as planned.

SECTION 6
S-II PROPULSION
6.1 SUMMARY
The S-II propulsion system performed satisfactorily throughout the flight.
As sensed at the engines, Engine Start Command (ESC) occurred at 163.04
seconds and Outboard Engine Cutoff (OECO) at 548.22 seconds with an
operation time of 385.18 seconds or 4.0 seconds shorter than predicted.
Due to high amplitude low frequency oscillations on the AS-503 and AS-504
flights, the center engine was shut down early as on AS-505 and success-
fully avoided these oscillations. Center Engine Cutoff (CECO) occurred at
460.62 seconds. Total stage thrust, as determined by computer analysis of
telemetered propulsion measurements, at 61 seconds after S-II ESC was 0.20
percent below predicted. Total propellant flowrate (including pressur-
ization flow) was 0.13 percent below predicted and stage specific impulse
was 0.07 percent below predicted at this time slice. Stage propellant
Mixture Ratio (MR) was 0.36 percent above predicted.
The propellant management system performance was satisfactory. The system
was similar to AS-505 in that it also used open-loop control of the engine
Propellant Utilization (PU) valves. On AS-506, however, the Instrument
Unit (IU) command to shift Engine Mixture Ratio (EMR) from high to low was
initiated upon attainment of a preprogramed stage characteristic velocity
as sensed by the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC). An IU timed
command served this function on AS-505. The IU EMR shift command occurred
6 seconds later than predicted and this deviation was due mainly to improper
scaling in the LVDC velocity computations. The actual shift from high to low
EMR occurred 9.5 seconds late when compared with the final propulsion
prediction. The additional 3.5 seconds result from a propulsion and
characteristic velocity presetting mismatch that was known prior to
flight. Future preflight operational trajectory events, IU programed
commands, and S-II propulsion prediction events will be reviewed for
compatibility.
OECO, initiated by the LOX low level cutoff sensors, was achieved following
a planned 1.5-second time delay. A small engine performance decay was
noted just prior to cutoff similar to AS-505, but was less severe than that
observed on AS-504 due to only four engines operating at cutoff. Residual
propellant remaining in the tanks at OECO signal was 3388 kilograms
(7471 1bm) compared to a prediction of 2623 kilograms (5783 1bm).

The performance of the LOX and LH₂ tank pressurization systems was
satisfactory. Ullage pressure in both tanks was more than adequate to
meet engine inlet Net Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP) requirements through-
out mainstage. As commanded by the IU, step pressurization occurred at
261.6 seconds for the LOX tank and 461.6 seconds for the LH₂ tank.
The engine servicing system performed satisfactorily except that the
engine No. 1 start tank pressure was 2.8 N/cm2 (4 psi) below redline at
prelaunch commit (-33 seconds). This low pressure was caused by a lower
than planned setting of the Ground Support Equipment (GSE) regulator
supplying hydrogen to the start tank. Corrective action being proposed
includes increasing the nominal setting of the GSE regulator and relaxing
the prelaunch commit redline to more closely approximate actual require-
ments. All start tank pressures and temperatures were well within require-
ments at S-II ESC.
The recirculation, pneumatic control and helium injection systems all
performed satisfactorily.
6.2 S-II CHILLDOWN AND BUILDUP TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE
The prelaunch servicing operations satisfactorily accomplished the engine
conditioning requirements. Thrust chamber temperatures were within
predicted limits both at launch and engine start. The thrust chamber
temperatures ranged between 101 and 119°K (-278 and -245°F) at prelaunch
commit and 131 and 150°K (-223 and -190°F) at engine start. Thrust chamber
temperature warmup rate during S-IC boost agreed closely with those experi-
enced on previous flights.
Engine start tank temperatures at the conclusion of chilldown ranged
between 95 and 100°K (-289 and -280°F) and were similar to AS-505. All
start tank temperatures and pressures were within the prelaunch and engine
start boxes, as shown in Figure 6-1, with the exception that engine No. 1
start tank pressure was 2.8 N/cm2 (4 psi) low at prelaunch commit (-33
seconds).
The low start tank pressures at -33 seconds resulted from the start tanks
being pressurized at 783 to 792 N/cm2 (1135 to 1148 psia) instead of the
required 810 +10.3 N/cm² (1175 +15 psia). It had been planned to set
both the GSE S-II pneumatic console dome regulator and the start tank supply
regulator at the high side of the tolerance. The dome regulator was
replaced during the -9 hour launch countdown hold without adjustment to
the high limit (refer to paragraph 3.6.2). Another factor contributing to
the low start tank pressures was that the pressure gauge used to set the
regulators was reading approximately 7.6 N/cm2 (11 psi) high. It is planned
to revise the pressurization regulator settings to provide a higher pressure
level for subsequent stages. It has also been recommended that the minimum
pressure line of the prelaunch redline box be lowered approximately
6.9 N/cm2 (10 psi). Review of all previous launch data indicates a lower
prelaunch pressure is compatible with the engine start box.

Figure 6-1. S-II Engine Start Tank Performance
All engine helium tank pressures were within the prelaunch and engine start
limits of 1931 to 2379 N/cm2 (2800 to 3450 psia). The helium supply line
was manually vented at -277 seconds versus being vented at -30 seconds on
previous launches. This allowed adequate time to monitor for leakage prior
to the -19 second launch commit. No pressure decay of any significance
occurred during this time period.
Engine No. 2 helium tank pressure decayed at a sharper rate than expected
after S-II ESC. The decay assumed a more normal rate after approximately
30 seconds of operation. This condition has occurred on previous flights
and has been coincident with shifts in the engine helium regulator outlet
pressure. Engine regulator outlet pressure measurement was not provided
on AS-506 so it can only be assumed that a regulator outlet pressure shift
also occurred. On AS-505 flight, engine No. 5 regulator outlet pressure
shifted from 281 to 276 N/cm2 ( 408 to 400 psia) at approximately 63 seconds
after ESC. On AS-504 flight, engine No. 3 regulator outlet pressure shifted
from 279 to 276 N/cm2 (405 to 400 psia) at approximately 43 seconds after
ESC. Between ESC and regulator shift the decay rates were higher than
expected, but following the shift the decay rates of all engines were
comparable.
6-3

--- PAGE 88 ---
The higher than expected helium tank decay rates experienced to date are
not critical for the S-II mission. Even if the initial decay rate continued
throughout S-II burn, the supply pressure would be adequate to meet system
demands with sufficient margin. The cause of this deviation has been
assessed as internal leakage through the engine helium regulator.
The LOX and LH₂ recirculation systems used to chill the feed ducts, turbo-
pumps, and other engine components performed satisfactorily during prelaunch
and S-IC boost. Engine pump inlet temperatures and pressures at engine
start were well within the requirements as shown in Figure 6-2. The LOX
pump discharge temperatures at ESC were 7.5 to 8.9°K (13.5 to 16.1°F)
subcooled, which is well below the 1.7°K (3°F) subcooling requirement.
Prepressurization of the propellant tanks was satisfactorily accomplished.
Ullage pressures at S-II ESC were 26.9 N/cm2 (39 psia) for LOX and
19.6 N/cm2 (28.5 psia) for LH₂.
S-II ESC was received at 163.04 seconds and the Start Tank Discharge Valve
(STDV) solenoid activation signal occurred 1.0 second later. The engine
thrust buildup was satisfactory and was within the required thrust buildup
envelope. The stage thrust reached mainstage level at 166.2 seconds.
Engine thrust levels were between 861,496 and 895,080 Newtons (193,672
and 201,222 1bf) prior to "High EMR Select" command at 168.5 seconds.
6.3 S-II MAINSTAGE PERFORMANCE
Stage performance during the high EMR portion of the flight was very
close to predicted as shown in Figure 6-3. At a time slice of ESC +61
seconds, total vehicle thrust was 5,141,516 Newtons (1,155,859 1bf) which
is only 10,094 Newtons (2269 1bf) or 0.20 percent below the preflight
prediction. Total propellant flowrate (including pressurization flow) was
1239 kg/s (2731 1bm/s) which was 0.13 percent below prediction. Stage
specific impulse, :including the effect of pressurization gas flowrate, was
4150.2 N-s/kg (423.2 1bf-s/1bm) which is 0.07 percent below the predicted
level. Stage propellant MR was 0.36 percent above prediction.
At ESC +297.58 seconds (460.62 seconds) the center engine was shut down in
order to prevent buildup of the low frequency oscillations that were
observed on AS-503 and AS-504. This action reduced total vehicle thrust
by 1,031,685 Newtons (231,932 1bf) to a level of 4,093,107 Newtons
(920,167 lbf). Of this total, a thrust reduction of 1,017,255 Newtons
(228,688 lbf) was directly due to CECO and the remaining 14,430 Newtons
(3244 lbf) decrease resulted from the sum effect of fuel step pressurization
(ESC +298.6 seconds) and loss of acceleration head.
The shift from high to low EMR operation occurred at approximately 335
seconds after ESC. The change of EMR resulted in further thrust reduction,
and at ESC +351 seconds the total vehicle thrust was 3,082,769 Newtons
(693,034 1bf); thus a decrease in thrust of 1,010,338 Newtons (227,133 1bf)
is indicated between high and the average low EMR operation.

--- PAGE 91 ---
Similar to AS-505 flight, the deviation of actual from predicted perform-
ance remained small at the lower mixture ratio levels. At ESC +381 seconds,
total thrust was 3,059,402 Newtons (687,781 1bf) at an EMR of 4.29. Vehicle
thrust and propellant flowrate deviations at this time were 18,683 Newtons
(4200 1bf) and 5.1 kg/s (11.2 1bm/s), respectively.
Individual J-2 engine data, excluding the effects of pressurization flow-
rate, are presented in Table 6-1 for the ESC +61-second time point. Very
good correlation between prediction and flight is indicated by the small
magnitude of the deviations. Flight data reconstruction procedures were
directed toward matching the engine and stage acceptance specific impulse
values while maintaining the engine flow and pump speed data as a baseline.
Data presented in Table 6-1 are actual flight data and have not been
adjusted to standard J-2 engine conditions. Considering data that have
been adjusted to standard conditions through use of a computer program,
very little difference from the results shown in Table 6-1 is observed.
The adjusted data show all engine thrust levels to be within 0.40 percent
of those achieved during vehicle acceptance test.
Three minor engine performance shifts were observed during S-II burn.
Engine No. 1 experienced two performance increases, each approximately
6672 Newtons (1500 lbf), during the first 35 seconds of mainstage operation.

--- PAGE 92 ---
A thrust decrease of about the same magnitude occurred in engine No. 2
after 64 seconds of mainstage operation. These shifts are indicative of
changes in the Gas Generator (GG) oxidizer system flow resistance and are
not considered detrimental to engine operation.
Amplified main chamber pressure processed with a 25 hertz low pass filter
revealed no high amplitude, low frequency oscillations as experienced on
AS-503 and AS-504. As in the flight of AS-505, CECO precluded any
oscillation buildup.
6.4 S-II SHUTDOWN TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE
Engine shutdown sequence was initiated by the stage LOX low level sensors.
The LOX depletion cutoff system again included a 1.5-second delay timer.
As in the AS-504 and AS-505 flights, this resulted in engine performance
decay prior to receipt of the cutoff signal. Due to early CECO however,
the precutoff decay was greatly reduced compared to AS-504 without CECO.
Only engine No. 1 exhibited a significant thrust chamber pressure decay,
decreasing 77.9 N/cm2 (113 psi) in the final 0.25 second before cutoff.
All other outboard engines thrust chamber pressure decays were of the
order of 20.7 N/cm2 (30 psi).
At OECO signal (548.22 seconds), total vehicle thrust was down to 2,783,479
Newtons (625,751 lbf). Vehicle thrust dropped to 5 percent of this level
within 0.75 second. The stage cutoff impulse through the 5 percent thrust
level was estimated to be 581,916 N-s (130,820 1bf-s). No unusual features
were apparent in the center engine thrust decay data following CECO, with
the decay to 5 percent thrust occurring in approximately 0.3 second.
6.5 S-II STAGE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT
The propellant management system performed satisfactorily during the
propellant loading operation and during flight. The S-II stage employed
an open-loop system utilizing fixed, open-loop commands from the IU rather
than feedback signals from the tank mass sensing probes. (Open-loop oper-
ation was also used on AS-503 and AS-505. It is also planned for use on
all subsequent vehicles.)
The facility Propellant Tanking Control System (PTCS) and the propellant
management system successfully accomplished S-II loading and replenishment.
During the prelaunch countdown, all propellant management subsystems
operated properly with no problems noted.
Open-loop PU system operation commenced when "High EMR select" was commanded
at ESC +5.5 seconds, as planned. The PU valves then moved to the high EMR
position, providing a nominal high EMR of 5.50 for the first phase of
Programed Mixture Ratio (PMR). The IU command to shift EMR from high to
low was initiated at ESC +331.8 seconds (6 seconds later than predicted)
upon attainment of a preprogramed characteristic velocity as sensed by the
LVDC. Approximately 5.5 seconds of this deviation is attributed to improper
scaling in the inflight calculations of velocity within the LVDC (refer to
6-8

--- PAGE 93 ---
paragraph 10.2.1), and the remainder is due to variations between the
actual and predicted flight performance. The IU command caused the PU
valves to be driven to the low EMR position, providing an average EMR of
4.34 (versus a predicted average EMR of 4.33) for the low mixture ratio
portion of the flight.
The actual shift from high to low EMR occurred 9.5 seconds late when com-
pared with the final propulsion prediction. The additional 3.5 seconds
result from a propulsion and characteristic velocity presetting mismatch
that was known prior to flight.
Engine No. 3 PU valve position monitor exhibited erratic characteristics
during the S-IC and S-II boost operational periods. Analysis of the
limited measurements available did not reveal any PU computer, telemetry
or engine malfunction. The PU valve telemetry potentiometer is the most
likely cause of this problem.
The open-loop PU control system responded as expected during flight and
no instabilities were noted. The open-loop PU error at OECO was approxi-
mately +567 kilograms (+1250 1bm) LH₂ versus a 3-sigma tolerance of +1134
kilograms (+2500 1bm).
Based on PU system data, propellant residuals (mass in tanks and sumps) at
OECO were 816 kilograms (1800 1bm) LOX, and 2572 kilograms (5671 1bm) LH2,
versus the predicted 657 kilograms (1448 1bm) LOX and 1966 kilograms
(4335 1bm) LH2. An updated analysis using AS-505 LOX depletion data
indicated a higher than predicted LOX residual would occur on AS-506. S-II
burn time was reduced approximately 4 seconds and the LH₂ residual at OECO
was increased 432 kilograms (952 1bm) due to the late PU valve step time.
Table 6-2 presents a comparison of propellant masses as measured by the PU
probes and engine flowmeters. The best estimate propellant mass is based
on integration of flowmeter data utilizing the propellant residuals deter-
mined from PU system data corrected for nominal tank mismatch at OECO.
Best estimates of propellant mass loaded are 370,778 kilograms (817,425 1bm)
LOX, and 71,615 kilograms (157,885 1bm) LH₂ which correlates closely with
the postlaunch trajectory simulation. These mass values were 0.24 percent
less than predicted for LOX and 0.07 percent less than predicted for LH₂.
6.6 S-II PRESSURIZATION SYSTEMS
6.6.1 S-II Fuel Pressurization System
LH₂ tank ullage pressure, actual and predicted, is presented in Figure 6-4
for autosequence, S-IC boost and S-II boost. The LH2 tank vent valves were
closed at -96 seconds and the ullage was pressurized to 24.8 N/cm2 (36 psia)
in approximately 27 seconds. One makeup cycle was required at -40 seconds
as a result of thermal pressure decay. Venting occurred during S-IC boost
as anticipated. One venting cycle was indicated on vent valve No. 1 between
93 and 100 seconds. There was no indication that vent valve No. 2 opened.

Differential pressure across the vent valve was kept below the low-mode
upper limit of 20.3 N/cm2 (29.5 psid). Ullage pressure at S-II engine
start was 19.6 N/cm2 (28.5 psia) meeting the minimum engine start require-
ment of 18.6 N/cm2 (27 psia). The LH₂ tank valves were switched to the
high vent mode immediately prior to S-II engine start.
LH₂ tank ullage pressure was maintained within the regulator range of
19.7 to 20.7 N/cm2 (28.5 to 30 psia) during burn until the LH₂ tank
pressure regulator was stepped open at 461.6 seconds. Ullage pressure
increased to 22.1 N/cm2 (32 psia). The LH₂ vent valves started venting
at 477 seconds and continued venting throughout the remainder of the S-II
flight. Ullage pressure remained within the high-mode vent range of 21 to
22.7 N/cm2 (30.5 to 33 psia).
Figure 6-5 shows LH₂ total inlet pressure, temperature and NPSP. The
parameters were close to predicted values. The NPSP supplied exceeded
that required throughout the S-II burn phase of the flight.
6.6.2 S-II LOX Pressurization System
LOX tank ullage pressure, actual and predicted, is presented in Figure 6-6
for autosequence, S-IC boost and S-II burn. After a two-minute cold helium
chilldown flow through the LOX tank, the vent valves were closed at -185.3
seconds and the LOX tank was prepressurized to the pressure switch setting
of 27.1 N/cm2 (39.3 psia) in approximately 42 seconds. One pressure makeup
cycle was required at -125 seconds as a result of pressure decay, which was
followed by the slight pressure increase caused by LH₂ tank prepressuriza-
tion. Ullage pressure was 26.9 N/cm2 (39 psia) at engine start.
The LOX regulator remained at its minimum position until 240 seconds
because the ullage pressure was above the regulator range of 24.8 to
26.5 N/cm2 (36 to 38.5 psia). A slight decrease in ullage pressure prior
to LOX regulator step pressurization indicated normal performance of the
LOX regulator. LOX step pressurization (261.6 seconds) caused the usual
characteristic surge in ullage pressure followed by a slower increase until
LOX tank ullage pressure reached a maximum of 28.3 N/cm2 (41 psia) at
383.4 seconds when the No. 1 vent valve cracked. Ullage pressure was
27.9 N/cm2 (40.5 psia) at CECO. Vent valve No. 1 reseat occurred at
27.9 N/cm2 (40.5 psia) after EMR shift. The LOX tank vent valve No. 2 did
not open.
LOX pump total inlet pressure, temperature and NPSP are presented in
Figure 6-7. The NPSP supplied exceeded the requirement throughout the
S-II boost phase. The total magnitude of LOX liquid stratification was
greater than predicted, but was similar to AS-505. The 1.5-second time
delay in the LOX low level cutoff circuit makes it very difficult to
predict an accurate cutoff temperature.

6.7 S-II PNEUMATIC CONTROL PRESSURE SYSTEM
Performance of the stage pneumatic control system was satisfactory. Main
receiver pressure and regulator outlet pressure were within predicted limits
throughout system operation. Regulator outlet pressure was within the
operating band of 476 to 527 N/cm2 (690 to 765 psia) except during valve
actuations which follow S-II ESC, CECO and OECO events. The makeup period
for the regulator outlet pressure to return to its operating band after
valve closures did not exceed 17 seconds. This is within the normal
recovery time.
Pressure decay in the main receiver from facility supply vent at -30 seconds
to the initial valve actuation at 168 seconds was negligible. Main receiver
pressure was 2086 N/cm2 (3025 psia) at S-II engine start.
6.8 S-II HELIUM INJECTION SYSTEM
The performance of the helium injection system was satisfactory. Require-
ments were met and parameters were in good agreement with predictions. The
supply bottle was pressurized to 2137 N/cm2 (3100 psia) prior to liftoff
and by ESC was 552 N/cm2 (800 psia). Helium injection system average total
flowrate during supply bottle blowdown (-30 to 163 seconds) was 2.0 SCMM
(70.4 SCFM).

SECTION 7
S-IVB PROPULSION
7.1 SUMMARY
The J-2 engine operated satisfactorily throughout the operational phase
of first and second burn. Shutdowns for both burns were normal. S-IVB
first burn duration was 147.1 seconds which was 3.4 seconds more than
predicted. The engine performance during first burn, as determined from
standard altitude reconstruction analysis, deviated from the predicted
by +0.20 percent for thrust and +0.05 percent for specific impulse. The
S-IVB stage first burn Engine Cutoff (ECO) was initiated by the Launch
Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) at 699.34 seconds.
The Continuous Vent System (CVS) adequately regulated LH₂ tank ullage
pressure at 13.4 N/cm2 (19.5 psia) during orbit, and the Oxygen/Hydrogen
(02/H2) burner satisfactorily achieved LH2 and LOX tank repressurization
for restart.
Engine restart conditions were within specified limits. The restart at
full open Propellant Utilization (PU) valve position was successful.
S-IVB second burn duration was 346.9 seconds which was 1.7 seconds less
than predicted. The engine performance during second burn, as determined
from the standard altitude reconstruction analysis, deviated from the
predicted by -0.56 percent for thrust and +0.05 percent for specific
impulse. The S-IVB stage second burn ECO was initiated by the LVDC at
10,203.07 seconds.
Subsequent to second burn, the stage propellant tanks were safed satis-
factorily, with LOX dump imparting a 17 m/s (55.8 ft/s) velocity change
to the stage.
7.2 S-IVB CHILLDOWN AND BUILDUP TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE FOR FIRST BURN
The propellant recirculation system performed satisfactorily, meeting
start and run box requirements for fuel and LOX as shown in Figure 7-1.
The thrust chamber temperature at launch was well below the maximum allow-
able redline limit of 172°K (-150°F). At S-IVB first burn Engine Start
Command (ESC), the temperature was 164°K (-164°F), which is within the
requirement of 150 +61.1°K (-189.6 +110°F).

Figure 7-1. S-IVB Start Box and Run Requirements - First Burn
7-2

--- PAGE 101 ---
The chilldown and loading of the engine Gaseous Hydrogen (GH2) start
sphere and pneumatic control sphere prior to liftoff were satisfactory.
The engine control bottle pressure and temperature at liftoff were
2124 N/cm2 (3080 psia) and 163°K (-169°F), respectively. At first ESC
the start tank conditions were within the required S-IVB region of
896.3 +68.9 N/cm2 and 133.1 +44.4°K (1300 +100 psia and -220 +80°F).
The discharge was completed and the refill initiated at first burn ESC
+3.7 seconds. The refill was satisfactory. The first burn start tran-
sient was satisfactory with thrust buildup within the limits set by the
engine manufacturer. This buildup was similar to the thrust buildups
observed on the AS-501 through AS-505 flights. The PU valve was in
proper null position prior to first start. The total impulse from first
Start Tank Discharge Valve (STDV) open to STDV +2.5 seconds was
857,243 N-s (192,716 lbf-s). This was more than the value of 833,615 N-s
(187,404 lbf-s) obtained during the same interval for the acceptance test.
First burn fuel lead generally followed the predicted pattern and resulted
in satisfactory conditions as indicated by the thrust chamber and fuel
injector temperatures.
7.3 S-IVB MAINSTAGE PERFORMANCE FOR FIRST BURN
The propulsion reconstruction analysis showed that the stage performance
during mainstage operation was satisfactory. A comparison of predicted
and actual performance of thrust, total flowrate, specific impulse, and
mixture ratio versus time is shown in Figure 7-2. Table 7-1 shows the
specific impulse, flowrates and mixture ratio deviations from the pre-
dicted at the STDV +137-second time slice when engine performance stabi-
lized. This time slice performance is the standardized altitude perfor-
mance which is comparable to engine tests. The 137-second time slice
performance for first burn thrust was 0.20 percent higher than predicted.
Specific impulse performance for first burn was 0.05 percent higher than
predicted.
S-IVB burn duration was 147.1 seconds which was 3.4 seconds more than pre-
dicted.
The helium control system for the J-2 engine performed satisfactorily
during first mainstage operation. Since the engine bottle was connected
with the stage ambient repressurization bottles there was little pressure
decay. Approximately 0.19 kilogram (0.42 1bm) of helium was consumed during
first burn.
The PU valve position shifted slightly away from the null position during
engine operation. This shift was in the closed (high Engine Mixture Ratio
[EMR]) direction and amounted to 0.7 degree during first burn and 0.6
degree during second burn. These shifts are approximately the same as
those observed on the AS-505 flight and the S-IVB-508 and S-IVB-509 accep-
tance tests. Valve position shifts during engine operation have occurred
only in engines with PU valves containing rotated baffles. The magnitude

of the flow forces for a PU valve with a rotated baffle (determined from
recent engine manufacturer testing) combined with the PU electronics gain
factor (feedback to control) results in an expected valve displacement of
approximately 0.75 degree.
It was concluded that the shift in valve position during the AS-506 flight
was due largely to the increased flow forces resulting from the rotated
baffle and possibly partly due to an electrical phase change. This ob-
served 0.6 to 0.8 degree shift in valve position during null PU operation
is expected to occur on AS-507 and subsequent flights.
7.4 S-IVB SHUTDOWN TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE FOR FIRST BURN
S-IVB ECO was initiated at 699.34 seconds by a guidance velocity
cutoff command. The ECO transient was satisfactory and agreed closely with
the acceptance test and predictions. The total cutoff impulse to zero
percent of rated thrust was 188,302 N-s (42,332 lbf-s). Cutoff occurred
with the PU valve in the null position.
7.5 S-IVB PARKING ORBIT COAST PHASE CONDITIONING
The LH2 CVS performed satisfactorily, maintaining the fuel tank ullage
pressure at an average level of 13.4 N/cm2 (19.5 psia).
The continuous vent regulator was activated at 758.5 seconds. Continuous
venting was terminated at 9320.4 seconds. The CVS performance is shown
in Figure 7-3.

Calculations based on estimated temperatures indicate that the mass vented
during parking orbit was 966 kilograms (2130 1bm) and that the boiloff
mass was 1081 kilograms (2383 1bm).
7.6 S-IVB CHILLDOWN AND RESTART FOR SECOND BURN
Repressurization of the LOX and LH2 tanks was satisfactorily accomplished
by the 02/H2 burner. Helium heater "ON" command was initiated at 9320.2
seconds. The LH2 repressurization control valves were opened at helium
heater "ON" +6.1 seconds and the fuel tank was repressurized from 13.4 to
20.8 N/cm2 (19.5 to 30.2 psia) in 193.7 seconds. There were 12.1 kilograms
(26.7 1bm) of cold helium used to repressurize the LH2 tank. The LOX
repressurization control valves were opened at helium heater "ON" +6.3
seconds and the LOX tank was pressurized from 25.0 to 27.8 N/cm2 (36.2 to
40.3 psi) in 145.3 seconds. There were 1.95 kilograms (4.3 1bm) of helium
used to repressurize the LOX tank. LH2 and LOX ullage pressures are shown
in Figure 7-4. The burner continued to operate for a total of 454.8
seconds providing nominal propellant settling forces. The performance of
the AS-506 02/H2 burner was satisfactory as shown in Figure 7-5.
The engine start sphere was recharged properly and maintained sufficient
pressure during coast. Between first and second burns, the rate of pres-
sure increase was less than predicted. Also the start bottle relief valve
regulated higher than the nominal setting.
The engine control sphere gas usage was as predicted during the first burn;
the ambient helium spheres recharged the control sphere to a nominal level
adequate for a proper restart.
The S-IVB propellant recirculation systems performed satisfactorily and
provided adequate conditioning of propellants to the J-2 engine for the
restart as shown in Figure 7-6. Second burn fuel lead resulted in satis-
factory conditions as indicated by the thrust chamber and fuel injector
temperatures. The start tank performed satisfactorily during the second
burn blowdown and recharge sequence.
The second burn start transient was satisfactory with thrust buildup
similar to the thrust buildup on flights AS-501 through AS-505. The PU
valve was in the proper full open (4.5 EMR) position prior to the second
start.
The total impulse from STDV to STDV +2.5 seconds was 794,114 N-s (178,524
1bf-s). This was less than the value of 833,615 N-s (187,404 lbf-s) ob-
tained during the same interval for the acceptance test.
The helium control system performed satisfactorily during second burn
mainstage. There was little pressure decay during the burn due to the
connection to the stage repressurization system. Approximately 0.553
kilogram (1.22 1bm) of helium was consumed during second burn.

7.7 S-IVB MAINSTAGE PERFORMANCE FOR SECOND BURN
The propulsion reconstruction analysis showed that the stage performance
during mainstage operation was satisfactory. A comparison of predicted
and actual performance of thrust, total flowrate, specific impulse, and
mixture ratio versus time is shown in Figure 7-7. Table 7-2 shows the
specific impulse, flowrates and mixture ratio deviations from the pre-
dicted at the STDV +172-second time slice. This time slice performance
is the standardized altitude performance which is comparable to the first
burn slice at 137 seconds.
The 172-second time slice performance for second burn thrust was 0.56 per-
cent lower than predicted. Specific impulse performance for second burn
was 0.05 percent higher than predicted. A shift in performance at the null
PU valve position (-1.5 degrees) occurred during second burn. A shift in
the Gas Generator (GG) system resistance is suspected as being the cause
of the down shift of 6859 Newtons (1542 lbf). Also, during second burn
several PU valve system resistance shifts are believed to have occurred.
S-IVB second burn duration was 346.9 seconds which was 1.7 seconds less
than predicted.
7.8 S-IVB SHUTDOWN TRANSIENT PERFORMANCE FOR SECOND BURN
S-IVB ECO was initiated at 10,203.07 seconds by a guidance velocity
cutoff command which resulted in 1.70 seconds shorter than predicted second
burn time. The transient was satisfactory and agreed closely with the
acceptance test and predictions. The total cutoff impulse to zero percent
of rated thrust was 239,061 N-s (53,743 lbf-s). Cutoff occurred with the
PU valve in the null position.
7.9 S-IVB STAGE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT
The PU system was operated in the open-loop mode. The PU system success-
fully accomplished the requirements associated with propellant loading.
A comparison of propellant mass values at critical flight events, as deter-
mined by various analyses, is presented in Table 7-3. The best estimate
full load propellant masses were 0.25 percent greater for LOX and 0.25 per-
cent greater for LH2 than the predicted values. These deviations were
well within the required loading accuracies.
Extrapolation of propellant level sensor data to depletion, using propel-
lant flowrates, indicated that a LOX depletion cutoff would have occurred
approximately 12.4 seconds after second burn velocity cutoff.
During first burn, the PU valve was positioned at null for start and re-
mained there, as programed, for the duration of the burn. The PU valve
was commanded to the 4.5 EMR position 119.9 seconds prior to second burn
start command, and remained there for 246.1 seconds. At second ESC +126.2

7.10 S-IVB PRESSURIZATION SYSTEM
7.10.1 S-IVB Fuel Pressurization System
The LH2 pressurization system operationally met all engine performance
requirements during prepressurization, boost, first burn, coast phase,
and second burn.
7-14

--- PAGE 113 ---
Following the termination of prepressurization, the ullage pressure
reached relief conditions, approximately 22.0 N/cm2 (32.0 psia) and re-
mained at that level until just after liftoff as shown in Figure 7-8. A
small ullage collapse occurred during the first 5 seconds of boost, and
then returned to the relief level at 70 seconds due to self pressurization.
All during the burn the ullage pressure was at the relief level, as pre-
dicted.
The LH2 ullage pressure was 21.4 N/cm2 (31.0 psia) at second burn ESC as
shown in Figure 7-9. Significant venting during second burn occurred at
second ESC +280 seconds when step pressurization was initiated. This
behavior was as predicted.
The LH₂ pump inlet Net Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP) was calculated from
the pump interface temperature and total pressure. Throughout the burn,
the NPSP had satisfactory agreement with the predicted. Figures 7-10 and
7-11 summarize the fuel pump inlet conditions for first and second burns,
respectively.

7.10.2 S-IVB LOX Pressurization System
LOX tank prepressurization was initiated at -167.5 seconds and increased
the LOX tank ullage pressure from ambient to 28.3 N/cm2 (41.1 psia) within
18.5 seconds as shown in Figure 7-12. Three makeup cycles were required
to maintain the LOX tank ullage pressure before the ullage temperature
stabilized. At -96 seconds the LOX tank ullage pressure increased from
27.4 to 28.5 N/cm2 (39.8 to 41.4 psia) due to fuel tank prepressurization,
LOX tank vent purge, and LOX pressure sense line purge. These conditions
plus boiloff caused the vent/relief valve to open, holding the pressure
at 28.8 N/cm2 (41.8 psia). The pressure remained at this level until lift-
off.
During S-IC boost there was a relatively high rate of ullage pressure decay
caused by an acceleration effect and subsequent thermal collapse, the decay
necessitated one makeup cycle from the cold helium spheres as shown in
Figure 7-12.

One makeup cycle was also required during S-II boost. Although ullage
cooling continued during this period, the major cause of the decay again
appears to be response to the vehicle acceleration. The LOX tank ullage
pressure was 27.7 N/cm2 (40.2 psia) at ESC.
During S-IVB first burn, three over-control cycles were initiated, as
predicted. Heat exchanger performance during first burn was satisfactory.
During the coast period between first and second burns the LOX ullage
pressure decreased from 29.0 to 25.0 N/cm2 (42.1 to 36.2 psia) which was
approximately 5 percent below the predicted minimum. Although this decay
was not a problem, it was greater than usual. The ullage pressure decay
could have been the result of a combination of factors, including bulk-
head heat transfer rate, initial coast ullage temperature, localized
boiling rates, and perturbations of the stage. The above possibilities
are still under investigation. The decay could also have been the result
of leakage through the LOX vent system although a leak of this magnitude
could not be detected by stage instrumentation, this possibility cannot
be completely eliminated.
Repressurization of the LOX tank prior to second burn was required. The
tank ullage pressure was increased from 25.0 to 27.9 N/cm2 (36.2 to 40.4
psia) prior to second ESC. At ESC the pressure was 27.7 N/cm2 (40.2 psia)
satisfying engine start requirements as shown in Figure 7-13.
Pressurization system performance during second burn was satisfactory,
having the same characteristics noted during first burn. As predicted,
there were no over-control cycles. Heat exchanger performance was satis-
factory.
The LOX NPSP calculated at the interface was 16.81 N/cm2 (24.38 psid) at
first burn STDV open. The minimum NPSP during burn was 17.1 N/cm2 (24.8
psid) at 100 seconds after ESC. This was 11.4 N/cm2 (16.6 psid) above the
required NPSP at that time.
The LOX pump static interface pressure during first burn followed the
cyclic trends of the LOX tank ullage pressure. The NPSP calculated at the
engine interface was 16.02 N/cm2 (23.24 psid) at second burn ESC. At all
times during second burn, NPSP was above the required level. Figure 7-14
and 7-15 summarize the LOX pump conditions for the first burn and second
burn, respectively.
The cold helium supply was adequate to meet all flight requirements. At
first burn ESC the cold helium spheres contained 171 kilograms (378 1bm)
of helium. At the end of the first burn, the helium mass had decreased
to 147 kilograms (325 1bm). At second burn ESC the spheres contained
132 kilograms (292 1bm) of helium. At the end of second burn the helium
mass had decreased to 75 kilograms (166 1bm). Figure 7-16 shows helium
supply pressure history.

7.11 S-IVB PNEUMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM
The pneumatic control and purge system performed satisfactorily during
all phases of the mission. System performance was nominal during boost
and first burn operations.
7.12 S-IVB AUXILIARY PROPULSION SYSTEM
The Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) pressurization system demonstrated
nominal performance throughout the flight and met control system demands
as required.
System pressures and propellant temperatures are presented in Table 7-4.
All APS engines performed satisfactorily with chamber pressures ranging
from 62 to 69 N/cm2 (90 to 100 psia).
The APS ullage engines were turned on at approximately 700 seconds and 9775
seconds for propellant settling and were turned on a third time at approxi-
mately 20,268 seconds to provide additional impulse for the slingshot
maneuver.
The propellant consumption curves and predictions are presented in Figure
7-17. Table 7-5 presents the APS oxidizer and fuel consumption at signifi-
cant events during the flight.

7.13 S-IVB ORBITAL SAFING OPERATIONS
7.13.1 Fuel Tank Safing
The LH2 tank was satisfactorily safed using three programed vent cycles
utilizing both the Non Propulsive Vent (NPV) and CVS as indicated in
Figure 7-18. The LH2 tank ullage pressure during safing is shown in
Figure 7-9. At second ECO, the LH2 tank ullage pressure was 22.4 N/cm2
(32.4 psia) and after three vents had decayed to approximately zero. The
mass of GH₂ and LH2 vented agrees well with the 1174 kilograms (2589 1bm)
of liquid residual and pressurant in the tank at the end of powered flight.
7.13.2 LOX Tank Dump and Safing
Immediately following second burn cutoff, a programed 150-second vent
cycle reduced LOX tank ullage pressure from 27.2 to 13.0 N/cm2 (39.4 to
18.9 psia) as shown in Figure 7-13. Data levels were as expected with
32 kilograms (71 1bm) of helium and 50 kilograms (110 1bm) of GOX being
vented overboard. As indicated in Figure 7-13, the ullage pressure then
increased due to self-pressurization and sloshing to 16.6 N/cm2 (24.1
psia) at initiation of LOX dump.

Figure 7-18. S-IVB LOX Dump and Orbital Safing Sequence

--- PAGE 127 ---
The 108-second LOX tank dump was initiated at 18,187.6 seconds and was
satisfactorily accomplished. A steady-state liquid flow of 0.024 m3/s
(380.6 gpm) was reached within 50 seconds.
Approximately 79 seconds after dump initiation, the measured LOX flowrate
showed a sudden increase indicating that gas ingestion had begun. Shortly
thereafter, the LOX ullage pressure began decreasing at a greater rate.
Calculations indicate the LOX residual, approximately 921 kilograms (2030
1bm), was essentially dumped within 100 seconds. Ullage gases continued
to be dumped until the programed termination. The tank pressure had de-
cayed to 15.4 N/cm2 (22.4 psig) at this time.
LOX dump ended at 18,295.8 seconds as scheduled by closure of the Main
Oxidizer Valve (MOV). A steady-state LOX dump thrust of 4003 Newtons
(900 lbf) was obtained. The total impulse before MOV closure was 318,048
N-s (71,500 lbf-s), resulting in a calculated velocity increase of 17 m/s
(55.8 ft/s). Figure 7-19 shows the LOX flowrate during dump and the mass
of liquid and gas in the oxidizer tank. This figure also shows LOX ullage
pressure and the LOX dump thrust produced. The predicted curves provided
for the LOX flowrate and dump thrust correspond to the quantity of LOX
dumped and the actual ullage pressure.
At 195 seconds after the end of LOX dump the LOX NPV valve was opened for
the duration of the mission. LOX tank ullage pressure decayed from 15.5
N/cm2 (22.5 psia) at 18,490.8 seconds to zero pressure at approximately
24,000 seconds.
7.13.3 Cold Helium Dump
Cold helium was dumped through the 02/H2 burner LH₂ heating coils and into
the LH2 tank, and overboard through the tank vents.
Three separate programed dumps totaling 3537 seconds were made starting at
10,264 seconds, as shown in Figure 7-16. During these periods, the pressure
decayed from 365 to 17 N/cm2 (530 to 25 psia). Approximately 73.9 kilograms
(163 1bm) of helium were dumped overboard.
7.13.4 Ambient Helium Dump
The ambient helium in the LOX and LH2 repress spheres was dumped through
the fuel tank. The 60-second dump was commanded on at 10,204.8 seconds
and started at 10,221.6 seconds when the LH2 tank pressure switch dropped
out and allowed the repress valve to open, The pressure in the fuel
repress spheres decayed from 2124 to 579 N/cm2 (3080 to 840 psia) and
15.6 kilograms (34.4 1bm) of helium were dumped.
7.13.5 Stage Pneumatic Control Sphere Safing
The stage pneumatic control sphere was safed by initiating the J-2 engine
pump purge and flowing helium overboard through the pump seal cavities.

7.13.6 Engine Start Sphere Safing
The engine start sphere was safed during an approximately 148-second
period starting at 10,206.3 seconds. Safing was accomplished by open-
ing the sphere vent valve. Pressure was decreased from 776 N/cm2
(1125 psia) to zero with 1.78 kilograms (3.93 1bm) of hydrogen being
vented.
7.13.7 Engine Control Sphere Safing
The engine control sphere safing began at 18,505 seconds. The helium
control solenoid was energized to flow helium overboard through the
engine purge system. The pressure decayed from 1379 to 103.4 N/cm2
(2000 to 150 psia) and 0.680 kilogram (1.50 1bm) of helium was vented
during the 1300-second safing period.

SECTION 8
HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS
8.1 SUMMARY
The stage hydraulic systems performed satisfactorily on the S-IC, S-II,
and first burn and coast phase of the S-IVB stage. During this period
all parameters were within specification limits.
The S-IVB hydraulic system pressure exceeded the upper limit by 0.6 per-
cent just after second burn ignition and remained at this level until
202 seconds into the burn. At this time a step decrease in system pres-
sure to a normal operating level occurred. The pressure remained at
this level for the remainder of the burn. Other than this minor devia-
tion system performance was nominal and no other problems were noted.
The manufacturer of the S-IVB engine driven hydraulic pump states that
the pump has an output pressure "drift-up" characteristic that could
account for this excess pressure. The abrupt pressure changes noted
during the burn are probably due to frictional hysteresis within the
engine driven pump pressure/flow-regulating mechanism. The pump manu-
facturer does not consider this condition to indicate impending mal-
function of the engine driven pump.
8.2 S-IC HYDRAULIC SYSTEM
The performance of the S-IC hydraulic system was satisfactory. All servo-
actuator supply pressures, and return pressures and temperatures were
within required limits.
8.3 S-II HYDRAULIC SYSTEM
System steady-state supply pressures during flight ranged from 2400 to
2468 N/cm2 (3480 to 3580 psia) with steady-state reservoir pressures
ranging from 63 to 70 N/cm2 (92 to 101 psia). These pressures were well
within the predicted ranges of 2275 to 2620 N/cm2 (3300 to 3800 psia)
and 54 to 72 N/cm2 (78 to 105 psia), respectively. Reservoir volumes at
Engine Cutoff (ECO) ranged from 16 to 21 percent, well within the pre-
dicted range of 12 to 34 percent. Reservoir fluid temperatures at ECO
8-1

--- PAGE 132 ---
ranged from 304 to 319°K (88 to 115°F) compared to a predicted 300 to
328°K (80 to 130°F). The reservoir fluid temperatures and rate of in-
crease of these temperatures compared well with predicted values.
Throughout the flight, all servoactuators responded to commands with
good precision. The maximum difference between actuator command and
position was 0.2 degree. Forces acting on the actuators were well below
a predicted maximum of 84,516 Newtons (19,000 lbf). The maximum force
in tension was 32,027 Newtons (7200 lbf) acting on the pitch actuator
of engine No. 1. The maximum force in compression was 35,586 Newtons
(8000 lbf) acting on the pitch actuator of engine No. 1.
8.4 S-IVB HYDRAULIC SYSTEM
The S-IVB hydraulic system performance was nominal during S-IC/S-II boost
and S-IVB first burn. The supply pressure was nearly constant at 2503
N/cm2 (3630 psia) as compared to an allowable of 2425 to 2527 N/cm2
(3515 to 3665 psia). System flow requirement was provided by the engine
driven hydraulic pump during first burn as indicated by a rise in system
pressure after ignition and an auxiliary pump motor current draw of 19.5
amperes. Power extraction by the engine driven pump during burn was
3.64 kw (4.88 horsepower).
Engine deflections were nominal during first burn.
During orbital coast, two hydraulic system thermal cycles of 48 seconds
duration were programed to start at 3300 and 6100 seconds.
The auxiliary hydraulic pump was turned on at 9497.2 seconds during second
burn prestart preparations. System operation was normal with output pres-
sure at 2487 N/cm2 (3610 psia) as shown in Figure 8-1. After second ESC
at 9848.2 seconds, as the engine driven pump commenced operation, the
system pressure increased to 2542 N/cm2 (3688 psia) which exceeded the
upper limit of 2526 N/cm2 (3665 psia) by 0.6 percent. At 10,050 seconds
system pressure dropped below the upper limit to 2505 N/cm2 (3632 psia)
and remained steady until 10,233.1 seconds when the auxiliary pump was
turned off. At 10,050 seconds, as the system pressure dropped, the
auxiliary pump motor current increased from 20 to 30 amperes indicating
that the auxiliary pump assumed an increased share of the hydraulic load.
System temperatures, actuator positions and auxiliary pump current loads
were normal during the burn and therefore this slight excess in system
pressure did not appear to cause any problems.
The pump manufacturer states that the engine driven hydraulic pump has a
"drift-up" characteristic which, when combined with uncompensated thermal
expansion in the pump compensator mechanism, makes a rise in output pres-
sure during second burn highly likely. It should be noted that the pre-
dicted upper limit of output pressure does not make allowance for this
pressure increase. The excessive system pressure after S-IVB second

Figure 8-1. S-IVB Hydraulic System - Second Burn

start is probably due to this effect. The abrupt changes noted during
the burn could be due to frictional hysteresis in the pressure/flow-
regulating mechanism shown schematically in Figure 8-2. The pump res-
ponse to a slowly changing demand would then consist of small step
changes in output pressure.
The pump manufacturer indicates that the frictional hysteresis may be
due to "silting" or entrapment of particulate matter in the small clear-
ance between the compensator spool and sleeve. These components have a
lap fit with a clearance of 0.00076 to 0.0010 centimeter (0.0003 to 0.0004
in.) whereas the circulating fluid has nominal 15 micron (0.00059 in.)
filtration. This added friction would increase the required force on the
spool before a response could occur. It should be noted however, that
the existence of silting is not necessary to explain this high friction.
The extremely small clearance of the lapped fit between the spool and
sleeve, possibly modified by normal wear in proportion to pump life,
could be a sufficient explanation. In any case, the pump manufacturer
considers that this condition does not indicate impending malfunction of
the engine driven pump.

STRUCTURES
9.1 SUMMARY
The structural loads and dynamic environments experienced by the AS-506
launch vehicle were well within the vehicle structural capability. The
longitudinal loads experienced during flight were nominal. The maximum
bending moment condition, 3.75 X 106 N-m (33.2 X 106 lbf-in.), was experi-
enced at 91.5 seconds and was lower than that experienced on any previous
flights. The maximum longitudinal loads on the S-IC thrust structure,
fuel tank, and intertank were experienced at 135.2 seconds, Center Engine
Cutoff (CECO). On all the vehicle structure above the intertank, the
maximum longitudinal loads were experienced at 161.6 seconds, Outboard
Engine Cutoff (OECO), at the maximum longitudinal acceleration of 3.94 g.
During the S-IC boost phase, low-level (+0.07 g) 4.8-hertz longitudinal
oscillations were detected in the Instrument Unit (IU) and peaked at
approximately 107 seconds. These oscillations occurred in the first
vehicle mode. Except for AS-502, the amplitudes of the oscillations were
slightly higher than those observed on other previous flights.
The S-IVB gimbal block longitudinal measurement recorded a small (+0.037 g
at 15.5 hertz) oscillation buildup at 252 seconds (S-II boost phase).
Similar oscillations were experienced on the AS-505 flight.
Low-frequency longitudinal oscillations similar to those experienced on
the AS-505 flight occurred during AS-506 S-IVB first and second burns.
The AS-506 first burn peak amplitude (+0.07 g at 19 hertz) was about 20
percent of the AS-505 peak amplitude (+0.3 g at 19 hertz). The second
burn oscillations peaked at approximately +0.12 g (13 hertz) at 10,172
seconds.
9.2 TOTAL VEHICLE STRUCTURES EVALUATION
9.2.1 Longitudinal Loads
The AS-506 vehicle liftoff occurred nominally at a steady-state accelera-
tion of approximately 1.2 g. Transients due to thrust buildup and release
resulted in a +0.13 g maximum longitudinal dynamic acceleration measured
9-1

--- PAGE 136 ---
at the IU. The slow-release rod forces measured during liftoff are pre-
sented in Figure 9-1.
The longitudinal loads that existed at the time of maximum aerodynamic
loading (91.5 seconds) are shown in Figure 9-2. The steady-state longi-
tudinal acceleration was 2.34 g, and the corresponding axial loads
experienced were nominal.
As shown in Figure 9-2, the maximum longitudinal loads imposed on the S-IC
thrust structure, fuel tank, and intertank occurred at 135.2 seconds (CECO)
at a longitudinal acceleration of 3.71 g. The maximum longitudinal loads
imposed on all vehicle structure above the S-IC intertank occurred at
161.6 seconds (OECO) at an acceleration of 3.94 g.
9.2.2 Bending Moments
The lateral loads experienced during thrust buildup and release were much
lower than design because of the low-level winds experienced during launch.
The wind speed at launch was 3.3 m/s (6.4 knots) at the 18.3-meter (60-ft)
level. The comparable launch vehicle and spacecraft redline winds were
18.9 m/s (36.8 knots) and 15.4 m/s (30 knots), respectively.

Figure 9-2. Longitudinal Load at Maximum Bending Moment,
CECO and OECO
The inflight winds that existed during the maximum dynamic pressure phase
of the flight were low, 9.6 m/s (18.7 knots), at the 11.4-kilometer
(37,400 ft) level and were increasing steadily at higher altitudes, as
shown in Figure A-1. The maximum bending moments on AS-506 were less than
the bending moments experienced on any previous Saturn V vehicle, less
than 15 percent of design criteria. As shown in Figure 9-3, the maximum
bending moment of 3.75 X 106 N-m (33.2 X 106 lbf-in.) was imposed on the
S-IC LOX tank at 91.5 seconds. Bending moment computations are based upon
measured inflight parameter$ such as thrust, gimbal angle, angle-of-attack,
dynamic pressure, and accelerations.
9.2.3 Vehicle Dynamic Characteristics
9.2.3.1 Longitudinal Dynamic Characteristics. The predicted first longi-
tudinal mode frequencies were present throughout the AS-506 S-IC boost
phase. As shown in Figure 9-4, the measured frequencies agree well with
the analytical predictions. The frequencies are determined by spectral
analysis using 5-second time slices.

Figure 9-4. First Longitudinal Modal Frequencies During
S-IC Powered Flight
9-4

--- PAGE 139 ---
The S-IC CECO and OECO transient responses measured at the Command Module
(CM) and the IU are shown in Figure 9-5. The decay of the CECO amplitudes
is comparable to previous flights, indicating that the vehicle damping in
the first mode is similar. Peak amplitudes of first mode oscillations
versus body station for the 135- to 138-second time slice are shown in
Figure 9-6. The amplitudes of several measurements on AS-504, AS-505, and
AS-506 are shown in this figure as well as a fit of the predicted first
vehicle longitudinal mode through the data points.
The most significant vehicle responses during the S-IC stage boost phase
were detected by the IU longitudinal (A2-603) measurements and the S-IC
intertank longitudinal (A1-118) measurements. As shown in Figure 9-7,
oscillations (4.7 to 5.2 hertz) began at approximately 102 seconds, peaked
at 107 seconds, and damped by 125 seconds. The peak amplitude measured
at the IU was +0.07 g at 4.8 hertz. Except for AS-502, oscillations in
the same frequency band, but at lower amplitudes, have been observed on
other previous flights with an amplitude of +0.05 g measured on AS-505 at
115 seconds. F-1 engine chamber pressures in the 4- to 5-hertz region
were below the 0.4 N/cm2 (0.5 psi) noise floor. The observed oscillations
were a response of the first longitudinal mode to flight environmental
excitations. POGO did not occur during S-IC boost.
During the S-II stage boost phase, a small response buildup was observed
by the S-IVB stage gimbal block longitudinal accelerometer (A12-403) at
252 seconds. The AS-506 amplitude peaked at +0.037 g at 15.5 hertz, as
shown in Figure 9-8. A similar response was observed during the AS-505
flight, +0.035 g (15 to 16 hertz), at 293 seconds. The S-II crossbeam
amplitude on AS-505 was +1.0 g. The crossbeam on AS-506 was not instru-
mented; however, since the AS-506 oscillations also occur in the high-
gain S-II crossbeam mode (15 to 16 hertz), the AS-506 crossbeam response
is estimated to have been +1 g (15.5 hertz), which is well below the design
limits.
Low-frequency longitudinal oscillations similar to those experienced on
AS-505 occurred during AS-506 S-IVB first and second burns. As shown in
Figure 9-9, the AS-506 first burn oscillation frequency ranges were identi-
cal (17 to 20 hertz); however, the AS-506 peak amplitude (+0.07 g) was
about 20 percent of the AS-505 peak amplitude (±0.3 g) at 19 hertz. The
AS-506 oscillations were intermittent, recurring at lower amplitudes
throughout the remainder of first burn. The LOX suction line inlet measure-
ment reached a maximum of +0.12 g and showed similar intermittent responses
throughout first burn, as shown in Figure 9-10. The data of Figure 9-11
show that the AS-505 and AS-506 peak amplitudes, determined by spectral
analysis using 2-second time slices, occurred at the same frequency and
near the same time during flight.

During S-IVB second burn, small longitudinal oscillations began on the
engine gimbal pad (A12-403) at about 10,164 seconds and peaked (+0.12 g)
at 10,1 seconds at the first longitudinal mode frequency of 13 hertz.
These oscillations were damped out by 10,184 seconds. Similar 13- to
16-hertz oscillations occurred on AS-505 and other previous flights at
approximately the same levels and range time.
The chamber pressure responses were in the noise floor in the 17- to 20-
hertz region during first burn and the 13- to 16-hertz region during second
burn. The LOX pump inlet and discharge pressure measurements showed in-
significantly low amplitudes throughout both S-IVB burns as did the longitu-
dinal accelerometers in the IU and CM.
The data show typical buildup and decay periods of low-level oscillations
without indications of propulsion/structural coupling. Since these oscil-
lations have been observed on previous flights, it is assumed that they
are characteristic of the stage and could be expected on future flights.
The 45-hertz oscillations that occurred just after the LH₂ step pressuriza-
tion event on AS-505 were not detected on AS-506. The AS-506 Non Propulsive
Vent (NPV) pressures showed very small, +0.35 N/cm2 (±0.5 psia), pressure
oscillations after step pressurization, as shown in Figure 9-12. The IU yaw

acceleration measurement (A7-603) showed no response to these small pres-

large, +1.4 N/cm2 (+2 psia), NPV pressure oscillations observed on the
AS-505 flight and the resulting 45-hertz vibration indicated by the A7-603
measurement. Therefore, it is assumed that the 45-hertz vibration did not
occur on the AS-506 flight.
9.2.3.2 Lateral Dynamic Characteristics. Oscillations in the first four
modes were detectable throughout S-IC powered flight. Spectral analyses
were performed to determine modal frequencies using 5-second time slices.
The frequencies of these oscillations agreed well with the analytical pre-
dictions, as shown in Figure 9-13.

SECTION 10
GUIDANCE AND NAVIGATION
10.1 SUMMARY
10.1.1 Flight Program
The guidance and navigation system performed satisfactorily at all times
for which data are presently available. The parking orbit and translunar
injection parameters are well within tolerance. The S-IVB LOX dump, LH₂
vent, and Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) ullage burn resulted in a
heliocentric orbit of the S-IVB/IU as planned.
The actual S-II Engine Mixture Ratio (EMR) shift occurred approximately
9.5 seconds later than indicated by the final stage propulsion prediction.
About 4 seconds of this deviation was attributed to the change in Launch
Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) nominal characteristic velocity presetting
predictions and variation in actual from predicted flight performance.
Approximately 5.5 seconds of the deviation are attributed to improper
scaling in the flight program calculation of characteristic velocity.
10.1.2 Instrument Unit Components
The LVDC, the Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA), and the ST-124M-3 iner-
tial platform functioned satisfactorily. The platform-measured crossrange
velocity (Y) exhibited a negative shift of approximately 1.8 m/s (5.9 ft/s)
at 3.3 seconds after liftoff. The probable cause was the Y accelerometer
head momentarily contacting an internal mechanical stop. Although this
had negligible effect on the launch vehicle, investigation to determine
the cause of the velocity shift is continuing.
10.2 GUIDANCE COMPARISONS
The postflight guidance error analysis was based on comparisons of the
ST-124M-3 platform measured velocities with the postflight trajectory
established from external tracking data. No precision tracking data were
available for trajectory construction; therefore, hardware error analysis
was limited to gross errors. The comparisons made and reported herein are
referenced to the AS-506 final (14 day) postflight trajectory. The boost-
to-parking orbit portion of the trajectory was a composite fit of C-Band
radar data. The second burn trajectory consists of ST-124M-3 measured
velocities constrained to orbital solutions.
10-1

--- PAGE 148 ---
Figure 10-1 presents the comparisons of the platform measured velocities
with corresponding values from the postflight trajectory. A positive
difference indicated trajectory data greater than the platform measurement.
The velocity differences at S-IVB first Engine Cutoff (ECO) were 1.52 m/s
(4.99 ft/s), 1.73 m/s (5.68 ft/s), and 0.54 m/s (1.77 ft/s) for vertical,
crossrange, and downrange velocity, respectively. Although the differences
at S-IVB cutoff are relatively small, the difference profiles do not re-
flect characteristic trends relative to platform system errors. These
trends were not shown because of the difficulty in constructing a boost
trajectory without precision tracking.
At approximately 3.3 seconds after liftoff, the crossrange velocity changed
-1.8 m/s (-5.9 ft/s) from one computer cycle to the next and appeared to
settle down with a bias in the accumulator. The comparisons with the post-
flight trajectory do not show this bias since the telemetered velocities
were smoothed and used to initialize the trajectory program. A comparison
of the crossrange velocities (Y) with the LVDC and Operational Trajectory
(OT) during the first 20 seconds of flight indicates a bias of about 1.2
m/s (3.9 ft/s). A more detailed discussion of this velocity change is
given in paragraph 10.4.7.

--- PAGE 149 ---
The platform velocity comparisons shown for the second S-IVB burn in
Figure 10-2 reflect differences in LVDC and postflight orbital solution
state vectors. The second burn portion of the postflight trajectory
was constructed by initializing to parking orbit solution and constrain-
ing the telemetered platform velocities to a state vector after Trans-
lunar Injection (TLI). Some portion of the velocity differences might be
attributed to platform misalignment due to drift. However, the differ-
ences build up to a maximum and then reverse slope indicating compensating
drifts. The accelerations in the pitch plane were positive for the entire
second burn, and the crossrange acceleration was less than -0.2 m/s (0.7
ft/s) for about 36 seconds after ignition and then went positive. If the
velocity differences were assumed to be the result of platform errors,
the curves would indicate g-sensitive drifts not compatible with the boost-
to-parking orbit data where much higher accelerations were experienced.
Work will be continued to resolve the state vector differences between
the LVDC and orbital solutions.

--- PAGE 150 ---
Velocities measured by the ST-124M-3 platform system at significant flight
event times are shown in Table 10-1 along with corresponding values from
both the observed postflight and operational trajectories. The differences
between the telemetered velocities and the observed postflight trajectory
values reflect some combination of small guidance hardware errors, track-
ing errors, and interpolation of data to specific event times. The differ-
ences between the telemetered and operational trajectory values reflect
off-nominal flight conditions and vehicle performance.
Comparisons of navigation (PACSS 13 coordinate system) positions, velo-
cities, and flight path angle at significant flight event times are pre-
sented in Table 10-2. The guidance (LVDC) and observed postflight tra-
jectory values are in relatively good agreement for the boost-to-parking
orbit burn mode. The initial error in crossrange velocity is reflected
in the displacement. The component differences at Time Base 6 and at TLI
are still under investigation. There appears to be a timing error of
about 2.7 seconds between the orbital solutions and the LVDC. The com-
ponent differences at parking orbit insertion, Time Base 6, and TLI are
given in Table 10-3.
The ST-124M-3 platform measurements and the LVDC flight program were
highly successful in guiding the AS-506 vehicle to near nominal end con-
ditions. A minimum of corrections were required for the spacecraft to
accomplish a near perfect mission.
10.2.1 Late S-II Stage EMR Shift
The S-II stage actual EMR shift occurred approximately 9.5 seconds later
than indicated by the final stage propulsion prediction. About 4 seconds
of this deviation was attributed to the change in IU LVDC nominal charac-
teristic velocity presetting predictions and variation in actual from
predicted flight performance.
About 5.5 seconds of the late EMR shift deviation was due to improper
LVDC scaling. The EMR routine is entered when a time-to-go quantity T₁,
becomes zero or negative. The T1i was larger than predicted because the
calculated characteristic velocity, upon which T1i is based, was smaller
than predicted.
The S-II characteristic velocity calculated in the IU was incorrect due
to an unfortunate combination of scaling situations in the LVDC flight
program. These scaling errors caused the calculated S-II stage charac-
teristic velocity (BNVC) to be low by approximately 91.7 m/s (300.9 ft/s)
at the time EMR shift should have occurred. BNVC is calculated as
follows:
DVCᵢ 2 = (AX² + AY2 + Z²)
ABNVC = 1/2(DVCi-1 + DVCᵢ/DVCᵢ_₁)
BNVCᵢ = BNVCi_1 + BNVC

During the calculation of BNVC, DVC 2 lost significant information due
to round off. The scaling factor required 28 bits of information. The
LVDC maintains only 25 bits of information. The three least significant
bits of information were lost by computer underflow. Another bit was lost
due to the binary arithmetic and hardware algorithm for division. As a
consequence, the apparent increase in BNVC per computer cycle was less
than the actual increase in BNVC. The total S-II characteristic velocity
error at the time of actual EMR shift was about 92.6 m/s (303.8 ft/s).
The deviation in EMR shift time caused no performance perturbation.
Figure 10-3 gives the differences between S-II stage correct BNVC values
and those computed by the LVDC flight program. Investigation is being
conducted to improve scaling in IU LVDC velocity calculations.
10.3 NAVIGATION AND GUIDANCE SCHEME EVALUATION
All analyzed guidance and navigation measurements indicated satisfactory
performance throughout the flight. The active guidance phases start and
stop times are given in Table 10-4. Included in this table are the start
and stop times in the artificial tau phases and chi freezes. The rate-
limited attitude commands shown in Figures 10-4 and 10-5 indicate near
nominal performances.
The flight program routine causing S-II EMR shift to be commanded was
entered later than predicted in the OT. This deviation is discussed in
paragraph 10.2.1.

Orbital guidance events were accomplished satisfactorily. All S-IVB stage
first and second burn guidance parameters indicate satisfactory operation.
The orbital insertion conditions after S-IVB first burn are given in Table
10-5. The TLI parameters after S-IVB second burn are given in Table 10-6.
10.4 GUIDANCE SYSTEM COMPONENT EVALUATION
10.4.1 LVDC Performance
The LVDC performed as predicted for the AS-506 mission. No valid error
monitor word and no self-test error data have been observed that indicate
any deviation from correct operation.
10.4.2 LVDA Performance
The LVDA performance was nominal. No valid error monitor words and no
self-test error data indicating deviations from correct performance were
observed.
10.4.3 Ladder Outputs
The ladder networks and converter amplifiers performed satisfactorily.
No data have been observed that indicate an out-of-tolerance condition
between Channel A and the reference channel converter-amplifiers.
10.4.4 Telemetry Outputs
Analysis of the available LVDA telemetry buffer and flight control com-
puter attitude error plots indicated symmetry between the buffer outputs
and the ladder outputs. The available LVDC power supply plots indicates
satisfactory power supply performance. The H60-603 guidance computer
telemetry was completely satisfactory.

10.4.7 ST-124M-3 Inertial Platform
The inertial platform system performed as designed. At 3.3 seconds after
liftoff, the Y velocity (crossrange) exhibited a change of approximately
-1.8 m/s (-5.9 ft/s). A lack of data prevents a precise determination of
the cause; however, the probable cause was the Y accelerometer head momen-
tarily contacting an internal mechanical stop. The forcing function was
probably crossrange polarized 35 to 40 hertz vibrations, the natural fre-
quency of the accelerometer servo loop.
The Y accelerometer head movement indicated significant incident vibrations.
However, the measurement was sampled rather than continuous so the frequency
and amplitude of the head motion cannot be readily defined.
The Y gyro was relatively unperturbed, but the X and Z gyros showed signi-
ficant activity. This indicates a forcing function, probably vibration,
mainly along the platform Y axis.
The body-mounted yaw accelerometer, A7-603, was oriented in the same
direction as the Y accelerometer. It indicated a generally high random
level of vibration which included significant amplitudes between 35 and
45 hertz. The amplitude is presently indeterminate because of telemetry
channel and band width limitations.
The X, Y, and Z gyro servo loops for the stable element functioned as
designed. The operational limits of the servo loops were not reached at
anytime during the mission.
The inertial gimbal temperatures fell below specifications; however, there
are no indications of degraded inertial performance. The temperature went
below the minimum specification of 313.15°K (104.0°F) at 15,600 seconds,
reaching 312.2°K (102.3°F) at approximately 20,800 seconds.

SECTION 11
CONTROL SYSTEM
11.1 SUMMARY
The AS-506 control system, which was essentially the same as that of AS-505,
performed satisfactorily. The Flight Control Computer (FCC), Thrust Vector
Control (TVC), and Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) satisfied all require-
ments for vehicle attitude control during the flight. Bending and slosh
dynamics were adequately stabilized. The prelaunch programed yaw, roll,
and pitch maneuvers were properly executed during S-IC boost.
During the maximum dynamic pressure region of flight, the launch vehicle
experienced winds that were less than 95-percentile July winds. The maxi-
mum average pitch and yaw engine deflections were the result of wind shears.
S-IC/S-II first and second plane separations were accomplished with no
significant attitude deviations. At Iterative Guidance Mode (IGM) initia-
tion, a pitch up transient occurred similar to that seen on previous
flights. At S-II early Center Engine Cutoff (CECO), the guidance para-
meters were modified by the loss of thrust. There was a change in yaw
attitude due to the slight thrust misalignment of the center engine. S-II/
S-IVB separation occurred as expected and without producing any significant
attitude deviations.
Satisfactory control of the vehicle was maintained during first and second
S-IVB burns and during coast in Earth Parking Orbit (EPO). During the
Command and Service Module (CSM) separation from the S-IVB/IU and during
the Transposition, Docking and Ejection (TD&E) maneuver, the control
system maintained the vehicle in a fixed inertial attitude to provide
a stable docking platform. Following TD&E, S-IVB/IU attitude control
was maintained during the maneuver to the slingshot attitude and during
the LOX dump and LH₂ vent.
11.2 S-IC CONTROL SYSTEM EVALUATION
The AS-506 control system performed adequately during S-IC powered flight.
The vehicle flew through winds which were less than 95 percentile for July
in the maximum dynamic pressure region of flight. Less than 10 percent of
the available engine deflection was used throughout flight (based on
average engine gimbal angle). S-IC outboard engine cant was accomplished
as planned.
11-1

--- PAGE 162 ---
All dynamics were within vehicle capability. In the region of high dynamic
pressure, the maximum angles-of-attack were 1.6 degrees in pitch and 1.4
degrees in yaw. The maximum average pitch and yaw engine deflections were
0.2 degree and 0.3 degree, respectively, in the maximum dynamic pressure
region. Both deflections were due to wind shears. The absence of any
divergent bending or slosh frequencies in vehicle motion indicates that
bending and slosh dynamics were adequately stabilized.
Vehicle attitude errors required to trim out the effects of thrust imbal-
ance, thrust misalignment, and control system misalignments were within
predicted envelopes. Vehicle dynamics prior to S-IC/S-II first-plane
separation were within staging requirements.
11.2.1 Liftoff Clearances
The launch vehicle cleared the mobile launcher structure within the avail-
able clearance envelopes. Camera data showing liftoff motion were not
available for the AS-506 flight, but simulations with flight data show
that less than 15 percent of the available clearance was used. The ground
wind was from the south with a magnitude of 3.3 m/s (6.4 knots) at the
18.3 m (60 ft) level.
The predicted and measured misalignments, slow release forces, winds, and
the thrust-to-weight ratio are shown in Table 11-1.
11.2.2 S-IC Flight Dynamics
Maximum control parameters during S-IC burn are listed in Table 11-2.
Pitch, yaw, and roll plane time histories during S-IC boost are shown in
Figures 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3. Dynamics in the region between liftoff and
40 seconds result primarily from guidance commands. Between 40 and 110
seconds, maximum dynamics were caused by the pitch tilt program, wind
magnitude, and wind shears. Dynamics from 110 seconds to S-IC/S-II sepa-
ration were caused by high altitude winds, separated air flow aerodynamics,
center engine shutdown, and tilt arrest. The transient at CECO indicates
that the center engine cant was 0.2 degree in yaw and -0.06 degree in
pitch.
At Outboard Engine Cutoff (OECO), the vehicle had attitude errors of -0.3,
0.1, and 0.0 degree in pitch, yaw, and roll, respectively. These errors
are required to trim out the effects of thrust imbalance, offset Center
of Gravity (CG), thrust vector misalignment, and control system misalign-
ments. The maximum equivalent thrust misalignments were 0.11, -0.05 and
-0.02 degree in pitch, yaw, and roll, respectively.
There was no significant sloshing observed. The engine response to the
observed slosh frequencies showed that the slosh was well within the
capabilities of the control system.

11.3 S-II CONTROL SYSTEM EVALUATION
The S-II stage attitude control system performance was satisfactory.
Analysis of the magnitude of modal components in the engine deflections
revealed that vehicle structural bending and propellant sloshing had
negligible effect on control system performance. The maximum values of
pitch and yaw control parameters occurred in response to IGM Phase 1
initiation. The maximum values of roll control parameters occurred in

response to S-IC/S-II separation disturbances. The control responses at
other times were within expectations.
Between the events of S-IC OECO and initiation of IGM, the vehicle atti-
tude commands were held constant. Significant events occurring during
this interval were S-IC/S-II separation, S-II stage J-2 engine start,
second plane separation, and Launch Escape Tower (LET) jettison. The
attitude control dynamics throughout this interval indicated stable opera-
tion as shown in Figures 11-6 through 11-8. Steady-state attitudes were
achieved within 20 seconds from S-IC/S-II separation. The maximum control
parameter values for the period of S-II burn are shown in Table 11-3.
At IGM initiation, the TVC received FCC commands to pitch the vehicle up.
During IGM, the vehicle pitched down at a constant commanded rate of
approximately -0.1 deg/s. The transient magnitudes experienced at IGM
initiation were similar to those of the AS-504 and AS-505 flights.
A steady-state pitch attitude error of approximately 0.15 degree resulted
from thrust imbalance. Following CECO, a steady-state yaw attitude error
of -0.3 degree occurred. Peak transient yaw attitude error after CECO
was -0.5 degree at 464 seconds. This yaw error occurred in response to
the loss of the compliance deflection of the center engine at cutoff. The
center engine was not precanted to allow for compliance deflection. This
compliance effect occurred in the yaw plane because of the location of the
fixed links. Consequently, the outboard engines were deflected in yaw
after CECO to compensate for the yaw attitude error and to stabilize the
vehicle. The deflections of the outboard engines in pitch after CECO were
the result of a pitch-up guidance command. This command was generated to
compensate for the effects that loss of center engine thrust would have
upon the flight trajectory.

Simulated and flight data for pitch, yaw, and roll plane dynamics are com-

are as follows: Steady-state yaw attitude error caused by early CECO which
reflects a lower compliance than predicted for the center engine; initial
transients in the roll axis which could be attributed to uncertainties in
thrust buildup of the J-2 engines; and steady-state attitude errors caused
by engine location misalignments and thrust vector misalignments.

11.4 S-IVB CONTROL SYSTEM EVALUATION
The S-IVB TVC system provided satisfactory pitch and yaw control during
powered flight. The APS provided satisfactory roll control during first
and second burns.
During S-IVB first and second burns, control system transients were ex-
perienced at S-II/S-IVB separation, guidance initiation, Engine Mixture
Ratio (EMR) shift, chi bar guidance mode, and J-2 engine cutoff. These
transients were expected and were within the capabilities of the control
system.
11.4.1 Control System Evaluation During First Burn
The S-IVB first burn attitude control system response to guidance commands
for pitch, yaw and roll are presented in Figures 11-9, 11-10 and 11-11,
respectively. The maximum attitude errors and rates occurred at IGM and
chi bar steering initiation. A summary of maximum values of the critical
flight control parameters during S-IVB first burn is presented in Table 11-4.
The pitch and yaw effective thrust vector misalignments during first burn
were 0.22 and -0.33 degree, respectively. A steady-state roll torque of
61.4 N-m (45.3 1bf-ft), counterclockwise looking forward, required roll
APS firings during first burn. The steady-state roll torque experienced
on previous flights has ranged between 27 N-m (20 1bf-ft) counterclockwise
and 54.2 N-m (40.0 lbf-ft) clockwise.
11.4.2 Control System Evaluation During Parking Orbit
The coast attitude control system provided satisfactory orientation and
stabilization of the S-IVB/CSM in parking orbit. The only maneuver during
parking orbit was to align the vehicle with the local horizontal just after
S-IVB first cutoff. Pitch axis control parameters during the maneuver to
the local horizontal are indicated in Figure 11-12. The yaw and roll con-
trol parameters did not show significant transients and are not presented.

11.4.3 Control System Evaluation During Second Burn
The S-IVB second burn attitude control system response to guidance commands
for pitch, yaw and roll are presented in Figure 11-13, 11-14 and 11-15,
respectively. The maximum attitude errors and rates occurred at guidance
initiation and EMR shift. A summary of maximum values of the critical
flight control parameters during S-IVB second burn is presented in Table
11-5.
The pitch and yaw effective thrust vector misalignments during second burn
were approximately 0.25 and -0.35 degree, respectively. The steady-state
roll torque during second burn ranged from 42.1 N-m (31.1 lbf-ft) at the
low EMR to 52.3 N-m (38.6 1bf-ft) at the 5.0:1.0 EMR.

11.4.4 Control System Evaluation After S-IVB Second Burn
The coast attitude control system provided satisfactory orientation and
stabilization from S-IVB second cutoff through the last data available.
The maneuver to the local horizontal just after second burn is shown in
Figure 11-16 for pitch and yaw control. Attitude control parameters in
pitch, yaw, and roll for the maneuver to the TD&E attitude are shown in
Figure 11-17. The vehicle attitude was inertially fixed for CSM separa-
tion and the TD&E maneuver. Pitch, yaw, and roll control during the
maneuver to slingshot attitude are shown in Figure 11-18. The magnitude
of the maneuver to slingshot attitude per axis was approximately 36
degrees, 41 degrees, and 10 degrees in pitch, yaw and roll, respectively.
During the LOX dump the S-IVB/IU was controlled to the -1.0 degree attitude
error limit in the pitch and yaw axis and approximately -0.4 degree in the
roll axis. This performance was expected and as designed.

SECTION 12
SEPARATION
12.1 SUMMARY
S-IC/S-II first plane separation was satisfactory. Related data indicate
that the S-IC retromotors performed as expected. Similarly, S-II second
plane separation and S-II/S-IVB separation were nominal. The S-II retro-
motors and S-IVB ullage motors performed as expected.
Command and Service Module (CSM) separation from the Launch Vehicle (LV)
occurred as predicted during translunar coast. The Transposition, Docking,
and Ejection (TD&E) maneuver occurred as expected. Attitude control of the
LV was maintained during each separation sequence.
12.2 S-IC/S-II SEPARATION EVALUATION
S-IC/S-II separation and associated sequencing were accomplished as planned.
Dynamic conditions at separation were within staging limits. Rate gyros
and accelerometers located on the Instrument Unit (IU) showed no disturb-
ances, indicating a clean severance of the stages. Data from the Exploding
Bridge Wire (EBW) firing unit indicate that S-IC retromotor ignition was
accomplished. The S-II ullage motors performed as predicted. Since there
were no cameras on the S-II stage, calculated dynamics of the interstage
and the S-II stage were used to determine if second plane separation was
within the staging requirements.
12.3 S-II/S-IVB SEPARATION EVALUATION
The S-II retromotors and the S-IVB ullage motors performed satisfactorily
and provided a nominal S-II/S-IVB separation. Dynamic conditions at
separation were within staging. limits with separation conditions similar
to those observed on previous flights.
12.4 S-IVB/IU/LM/CSM SEPARATION EVALUATION
Separation of the CSM from the LV was accomplished as planned. There
were no large control disturbances noted during the separation.
12-1

--- PAGE 184 ---
12.5 LUNAR MODULE DOCKING AND EJECTION EVALUATION
The attitude of the LV was adequately maintained during the docking of
the CSM with the Lunar Module (LM). The CSM/LM was then successfully
spring ejected from the LV. There were no significant control disturb-
ances during the ejection.

SECTION 13
ELECTRICAL NETWORKS
13.1 SUMMARY
The AS-506 launch vehicle electrical systems performed satisfactorily
throughout all phases of flight. Operation of the batteries, power
supplies, inverters, Exploding Bridge Wire (EBW) firing units, switch
selectors, and interconnecting cabling was normal.
13.2 S-IC STAGE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
The voltage for Battery No. 1 (Operational) and Battery No. 2 (Instrumen-
tation) remained within performance limits of 26.5 to 32.0 vdc during
powered flight. Battery currents were near predicted and below the maximum
limit of 64 amperes for both Battery No. 1 and Battery No. 2. Battery
power consumption was well within the rated capacity of 640 ampere-minutes
for both Battery No. 1 and Battery No. 2, as shown in Table 13-1.
The two measuring power supplies remained within the 5 +0.05 vdc design
limit during powered flight.

All switch selector channels functioned correctly, and all outputs were
issued within their required time limits in response to commands from
the Instrument Unit (IU).
The separation and retromotor EBW firing units were armed and triggered
as programed. Charging times and voltages were within the requirements
of 1.5 seconds for maximum allowable charging time and 4.2 +0.4 volts
for the allowable voltage level.
The command destruct EBW firing units were in the required state of
readiness if vehicle destruct became necessary.
13.3 S-II STAGE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
All battery bus voltages remained within specified limits throughout the
prelaunch and flight periods, and bus currents remained within required
and predicted limits. Main bus current averaged 36 amperes during S-IC
boost and varied from 49 to 57 amperes during S-II boost. Instrumentation
bus current averaged 23 amperes during S-IC and S-II boost. Recirculation
bus current averaged 97 amperes during S-IC boost, and ignition bus current
averaged 31 amperes during the S-II ignition sequence. Battery power
consumption was well within the rated capacities of the batteries as
shown in Table 13-2.

The five temperature bridge power supplies and the three 5-vdc instru-
mentation power supplies all performed within acceptable limits. The five
LH₂ recirculation inverters that furnish power to the recirculation pumps
operated properly throughout the J-2 engine chilldown period.
All switch selector channels functioned correctly, and all outputs were
issued within their required time limits in response to commands from the
IU. Performance of the EBW circuitry for the separation system was
satisfactory. Firing units charge and discharge responses were within
predicted time and voltage limits. The command EBW firing units were in
the required state of readiness if vehicle destruct became necessary.
13.4 S-IVB STAGE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
The voltages, currents, and temperatures of the three 28-vdc and one
56-vdc batteries stayed well within acceptable limits as shown in
Figures 13-1 through 13-4. Battery temperatures remained below the 322°K
(120°F) limit during the powered portions of flight. (This limit does not
apply after insertion into orbit.) The highest temperature of 316.5°K
(110°F) was reached on Aft Battery No. 2, Unit 1, after S-IVB first burn
cutoff. Battery power consumption is shown in Table 13-3.
All switch selector channels functioned correctly, and all outputs were
issued within their required time limits in response to commands from

The three 5-vdc and seven 20-vdc excitation modules all performed within
acceptable limits. The LOX and LH₂ chilldown inverters that furnish power -
to the LOX and LH2 recirculation pumps performed satisfactorily and met
their load requirements.
Performance of the EBW circuitry for the separation system was satisfac-
tory. Firing units charge and discharge responses were within predicted
time and voltage limits. The command destruct EBW firing units were in
the required state of readiness if vehicle destruct became necessary.
13.5 INSTRUMENT UNIT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
All battery voltages and temperatures increased gradually from liftoff as
expected. All battery voltages remained within normal limits. Battery
currents remained normal during launch and coast periods of flight.
Battery power consumption and estimated depletion times are shown in
Table 13-4. Battery voltages, currents, and temperatures are shown in
Figures 13-5 through 13-7.
The 56-vdc power supply maintained an output voltage of 55.7 to 56.6 vdc,
well within the required tolerance of 56 +2.5 vdc.
The 5-volt measuring power supply performed nominally, maintaining a
constant voltage within specified tolerances.
Switch selector, electrical distributors, and network cabling performed
nominally.

SECTION 14
RANGE SAFETY AND COMMAND SYSTEMS
14.1 SUMMARY
Data indicated that the redundant Secure Range Safety Command Systems
(SRSCS) on the S-IC, S-II and S-IVB stages were ready to perform their
functions properly on command if flight conditions during the launch
phase had required vehicle destruct. The system properly safed the S-IVB
SRSCS on a command transmitted from Bermuda (BDA). The performance of
the Command and Communications System (CCS) in the Instrument Unit (IU)
was satisfactory, except for the Radio Frequency (RF) problem noted in
paragraph 19.4.3.2.
14.2 SECURE RANGE SAFETY COMMAND SYSTEMS
Telemetered data indicated that the command antennas, receivers/ decoders,
Exploding Bridge Wire (EBW) networks, and destruct controllers on each
powered stage functioned properly during flight and were in the required
state of readiness if flight conditions during the launch phase had re-
quired vehicle destruct. Since no arm/cutoff or destruct commands were
required, all data except receiver signal strength remained unchanged
during the flight. Power to the system was cut off at 723.5 seconds by
ground command from BDA, thereby deactivating (safing) the system. Both
S-IVB stage systems, the only systems in operation at this time, responded
properly to the safing command.
Radio Frequency (RF) performance aspects of the system are discussed in
paragraph 19.4.3.1.
14.3 COMMAND AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
The command section of the CCS operated satisfactorily except for the RF
problem noted in paragraph 19.4.3.2. Twenty commands were initiated by
Mission Control Center - Houston (MCC-H) for transmission via the Gold-
stone (GDS) Wing Station, as shown in Table 14-1. The last 11 commands
were initiated with the ground station in the Message Acceptance Pulse
(MAP) override mode. The MAP override mode was necessary because the
telemetry data was noisy and the Address Verification Pulses (AVP's)
and Computer Reset Pulses (CRP's) could not be detected at the ground
14-1

station. A total of 50 command words were attempted by the GDS Wing
Station.
The command at 19,033.7 seconds (05:17:13.7) to switch the CCS coaxial
switch to the low-gain directional antenna position was unsuccessfully
transmitted four times. The command was not received by the onboard
equipment because the uplink subcarrier was not in lock. Upon comple-
tion of the automatic command cycle (the ground station is set up to
automatically transmit the command word four times or until the AVP's
and CRP's are received), a terminate command was issued to reset the
command system and the switch command was again attempted at 19,062.3
seconds (05:17:42.3). During this second transmission, the ground com-
puter failed to capture the AVP's and CRP's, resulting in the command
being repeated three times. The verification pulses were missed because

of noisy telemetry due to low downlink signal strength. Acceptance of
the command was verified by an increase in signal strength and by the
antenna position measurement (K132-603) indicating the CCS coaxial
switch was in the low-gain antenna position.
Noisy telemetry resulted in a repeated command at 27,367.7 seconds
(07:36:07.7) to transfer the CCS coaxial switch to the high-gain antenna
position. The command was repeated once before the ground computer de-
tected the acceptance pulses and terminated transmission of the command.
Transmission of the CCS disable command was unsuccessful when attempted
at both 32,019.3 seconds (08:53:39.3) and 32,066.6 seconds (08:54:26.6)
due to noisy telemetry. The noise prevented the ground station from
detecting the AVP's and CRP's. Therefore, acceptance of the mode word
could not be verified. The mode word was transmitted eight times before
the MAP override mode was selected and the complete command transmitted
(one mode and two data words). The command was accepted on this third
attempt at 32,601.4 seconds (09:03:21.4).
The command to enable the CCS at 34,160.0 seconds (09:29:20.0) was not
transmitted by the ground station because the 70-kilohertz subcarrier
was off. This meant that the CCS downlink was inhibited from 34,105.3
seconds (09:28:25.3) (CCS disable command) until the enable command trans-
mitted at 34,554.9 seconds (09:35:54.9) was accepted. This mode was
verified by the signal strength level during this period (see paragraph
19.4.3.2). Since the downlink was inhibited during this period, no AVP's
and CRP's were received for the antenna switching commands and the dis-
able command was not transmitted during this period.
The acceptance status of the commands transmitted during the period in
which the CCS was inhibited is unknown except for the two commands to
switch to the omni antennas. One or both of these commands, 34,234.5
seconds (09:30:34.5) and 34,419.9 seconds (09:33:39.9), were accepted by
the onboard system because measurement K131-603 indicated the system was
on the omni antennas when the downlink signal returned at 34,555 seconds
(09:35:55).

SECTION 15
EMERGENCY DETECTION SYSTEM
15.1 SUMMARY
The performance of the AS-506 Emergency Detection System (EDS) was normal,
and no abort limits were exceeded.
15.2 SYSTEM EVALUATION
15.2.1 General Performance
The AS-506 EDS configuration was the same as on AS-505. All launch vehi-
cle EDS parameters remained well within acceptable limits during the
AS-506 mission. EDS related sequential events and discrete indications
occurred as expected.
15.2.2 Propulsion System Sensors
The performance of all thrust OK sensors, which monitor engine status,
was nominal insofar as EDS operation was concerned. The associated voting
logic was also nominal. S-II and S-IVB tank ullage pressures remained
within the abort limits, and displays to the crew were normal.
15.2.3 Flight Dynamics and Control Sensors
As noted in Section 11, none of the triple redundant rate gyros gave any
indication of angular overrate in the pitch, yaw, or roll axes. The maxi-
mum angular rates were well below the abort limits. The roll rate abort
limit is 20 deg/s; a switch selector command deactivated the overrate
automatic abort and changed the pitch and yaw rate abort settings from
4 deg/s to 9.2 deg/s at 134.8 seconds.
The maximum angle-of-attack dynamic pressure sensed by a redundant Q-ball
mounted atop the escape tower was 0.28 N/cm2 (0.4 psid) between 89 and
91 seconds. This pressure was only 12.5 percent of the EDS abort limit
of 2.2 N/cm2 (3.2 psid).

SECTION 16
VEHICLE PRESSURE ENVIRONMENT
16.1 SUMMARY
The S-IC stage base pressure environments were monitored by two heat
shield differential pressure measurements. S-II stage base pressure
environments were monitored by two absolute pressure measurements on the
heat shield and one on the thrust cone. The flight data were generally
in good agreement with the postflight predictions and compared well with
previous flight data. The pressure environments were well below design
levels.
There was no instrumentation provided on the AS-506 vehicle which would
permit a direct evaluation of the surface and compartment pressure
environments. One internal ambient pressure measurement located on the
S-II forward skirt was used to calculate the pressure loading acting on
that area and agreed with predictions and previous flight data.
16.2 BASE PRESSURES
16.2.1 S-IC Base Pressures
The S-IC stage base heat shield pressure loading was recorded by two
differential pressure measurements. Both measurements show good agreement
with previous flight data as shown in Figure 16-1. Pressure loading is
the difference between internal and external pressures (Pint-Pbase) defined
such that positive loading is in the burst direction. The heat shield
loadings were well within the 1.4 N/cm2 (2.0 psid) design pressure loading.
16.2.2 S-II Base Pressures
The S-II stage base heat shield and thrust cone pressure environment was
recorded by two absolute pressure measurements on the heat shield and one
absolute pressure measurement on the thrust cone.
Except for the absence of a more significant drop in measured aft face
pressure at S-II Center Engine Cutoff (CECO), Figure 16-2 shows good
agreement between the postflight predicted and AS-506 flight heat shield
aft face static pressure history. It is seen that the AS-506 pressure
falls within the AS-501 through AS-505 data band. The predicted pressure
drop after S-II CECO is based on the computed total pressure loss resulting

from the reverse flow passing through a shock wave above the nozzle
lip of the inoperative center engine. Based on AS-505 flight data, a
somewhat smaller but still measurable drop was expected for the
D158-206 measurement. The further pressure reduction occurring after
Engine Mixture Ratio (EMR) shift is predicted from the reduction of the
maximum pressure in the J-2 engine exhaust plume interaction regions.
Figure 16-3 shows the static pressure variation with range time on the
forward face of the base heat shield. It is seen that the AS-506
measured static pressure on the forward face of the heat shield, while
within design limits, exceeds the postflight prediction and was

approximately 30 percent higher than that measured during the AS-501 and
AS-502 flights. No pressure measurement was available at this exact
location during the AS-503 through AS-505 flights. This condition is
believed to be a localized effect due to variable leakage through the J-2
engine nozzle flexible curtains.
Figure 16-4 shows the AS-506 static pressure variation on the thrust

16.3 SURFACE PRESSURE AND COMPARTMENT VENTING
16.3.1 S-IC Stage
There was no instrumentation on the S-IC stage for evaluation of the
surface and compartment pressure environments.
16.3.2 S-II Stage
Other than the internal ambient pressure measurement (D163-219) located
on the forward skirt, there was no instrumentation on the S-II stage for
evaluation of the surface and compartment pressure environments. A
calculated pressure loading (Pint-Pext) on the forward skirt was obtained
by taking the difference between the predicted external pressure values
and the internal pressure (assumed uniform), which was measured at
vehicle longitudinal station 62.2 m (2449 in.) and peripheral angle of
191 degrees (see Figure 16-5). The AS-506 flight data (calculated) show
the same trends and are in good agreement with the postflight predictions
and previous flight data.

VEHICLE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT
17.1 SUMMARY
The AS-506 S-IC base region thermal environments have similar magnitudes
and trends as those measured during previous flights. Maximum values of
total heating and gas temperature were recorded at approximately 20 kilo-
meters (10.8 n mi) altitude with maximum values of 25 watt/cm2
(22.2 Btu/ft²-s) and 1200°K (1695°F), respectively.
In general, base thermal environments on the S-II stage were similar to
those measured on previous flights and were well below design limits.
However, the heat shield aft radiation heating rates were approximately
20 percent higher than the maximum values measured during previous flights.
Flow separation was observed (ALOTS film) to occur at approximately 116
seconds range time. Aerodynamic heating environments were not measured
on AS-506.
17.2 S-IC BASE HEATING
Thermal environments in the base region of the S-IC stage were recorded by
two total calorimeters and two gas temperature probes which were on the
heat shield at the locations shown in Figure 17-1. Data from these
instruments are compared with the AS-502 through AS-505 flight data band
(Figures 17-2 and 17-3) and are shown versus altitude to minimize trajec-
tory differences. AS-501 flight data, which showed less severity than
subsequent flight data because of flow deflector effects, are not shown.
As shown in Figures 17-2 and 17-3, the AS-506 S-IC base heat shield thermal
environments have similar magnitudes and trends as those measured during
the previous flights. Maximum values of total heating and gas temperature
data were recorded at approximately 20 kilometers (10.8 n mi) with maximum
values of 25 watt/cm2 (22.2 Btu/ft2-s) and 1200°K (1695°F), respectively.
Center Engine Cutoff (CECO) on AS-506 produced a spike in the data with a
magnitude and duration similar to previous flight data at CECO. The
AS-506 gas temperature data are similar to previous flight data. However
the AS-506 and AS-505 gas temperature data do not show the decrease
between 4 and 9 kilometers (2.2 and 4.9 n mi) which the AS-502 through
AS-504 flight data indicated.

17.3 S-II BASE REGION ENVIRONMENT
The S-II base heat shield flight environments were, in general, in good
agreement with previous flight data and were well below design limits.
S-II heat shield aft face convective heating rates, aft radiation heating
rates, and base gas temperatures are presented in Figures 17-4 through 17-6,
along with previous flight data and postflight predictions. The postflight
predicted heat shield convective heating rates are based on hot flow 1/25
scale S-II stage model test data. Postflight predictions for the other
two figures were accomplished by the same analytical methods that have
been described in previous flight evaluation reports.

Figure 17-5. Heat Shield Aft Radiation Heat Rate
Figure 17-5 shows that the incident radiative heat flux during the AS-506
flight was greater than predicted and approximately 20 percent higher than
the maximum values measured during flights AS-501 through AS-505. The
most probable cause for this increase is engine misalignment or engine
gimbaling, neither of which are accounted for in the postflight prediction
of the incident radiative heat flux.
There were no measurements of structural temperatures made on the AS-506
S-II stage base heat shield. To evaluate the structural temperatures
experienced on the aft surface of the heat shield, a maximum postflight

predicted temperature was calculated for the aft surface using base
heating rates predicted for the AS-506 flight. The predicted maximum
postflight temperature was 818°K (1014°F) which compared favorably with
maximum postflight temperatures predicted from previous flights, and was
well below the maximum design temperatures of 1066°K (1460°F) for the
no-engine-out case and 1116°K (1550°F) for the one control engine-out
case.

--- PAGE 211 ---
The effectiveness of the heat shield and flexible curtains as a thermal
protection system was again demonstrated on this flight as on previous
flights by the relatively low temperatures recorded on the thrust cone
forward surface. The AS-506 maximum measured thrust cone forward surface
temperature was 266°K (20°F), essentially equal to that recorded during
previous flights. The measured temperatures were well below design values
and in good agreement with postflight predictions.
17.4 VEHICLE AEROHEATING THERMAL ENVIRONMENT
17.4.1 S-IC Stage Aeroheating Environment
The aerodynamic heating environments were not measured on the AS-506
S-IC stage. However, flow separation was measurable from flight optical
data (ALOTS film) and was observed to occur at approximately the same
time as on AS-505, 116 seconds as shown in Figure 17-7. The effects. of
CECO on the separated flow region during AS-506 flight were the same as
observed on previous flights. It should be noted that at higher altitudes,
the measured location of the forward point of flow separation is question-
able because of loss of resolution in the flight optical data.

There were no aerodynamic heating environments measured on the S-II stage;
however, postflight predicted temperatures were determined based on the
actual AS-506 trajectory and thermal models used in previous flight
evaluations. All postflight predicted temperatures were well below the
design limits and within the band of previous flight data.

SECTION 18
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM
18.1 SUMMARY
The S-IC canister conditioning system and the aft environmental condi-
tioning system performed satisfactorily during the AS-506 countdown.
The S-II thermal control and compartment conditioning system apparently
performed satisfactorily since the ambients external to the containers
were nominal and there were no problems with the equipment in the con-
tainers.
The Instrument Unit (IU) Environmental Control System (ECS) exhibited
overall satisfactory performance for the duration of the IU mission.
Coolant temperatures, pressures, and flowrates were continuously main-
tained within required ranges and design limits. One deviation from
specification was observed. The inertial platform gas bearing
differential pressure drifted above the 10.7 N/cm2 (15.5 psid) maximum
to 11.2 N/cm2 (16.3 psid). This drifting phenomenon also occurred on
on AS-501, AS-503, and AS-504 and caused no detrimental effect on the
mission.
18.2 S-IC ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
The ambient temperatures of the 4 canisters in the S-IC forward skirt com-
partment must be maintained at 300 +11°K (80 +20°F) during equipment
operation prior to J-2 engine chilldown and 325 to 278°K (125 to 40°F)
during J-2 engine chilldown. No canister conditioning is required after
S-IC forward umbilical disconnect.
The canister conditioning system was supplied with air/GN₂ (gaseous nitro-
gen) at a flowrate of 17.24 kg/min (38 1bm/min) and a temperature of
299°K (79°F) through the S-IC forward lower umbilical and at a flowrate
of 15.42 kg/min (34 1bm/min) and a temperature of 301°K (81°F) through
the S-IC forward upper umbilical during AS-506 countdown prior to J-2
engine chilldown. During J-2 engine chilldown, the flowrate and tempera-
ture of the GN₂ supplied to the forward upper umbilical was increased to
18.82 kg/min (41.5 1bm/min) and 311°K (100°F), and the temperature of the
GN₂ supplied to the forward lower umbilical was increased to 314°K (105°F).
No instrumentation was installed in the canisters on AS-506; therefore,
18-1

--- PAGE 214 ---
no evaluation of the actual temperatures within the canisters was possi-
ble. No failure of any electrical/electronic equipment installed in the
canisters was reported.
During J-2 engine chilldown, the thermal environment is at the most
critical point. Within this period the ambient temperature in the for-
ward skirt compartment dropped as shown in Figure 18-1. The lowest
ambient temperature measured during AS-506 J-2 engine chilldown was 229°K
(-48°F) at instrument location C206-120. During AS-506 flight, the
lowest temperature recorded was 183°K (-130°F) at instrument location
C206-120.
The design requirement for the aft compartment is that the ambient tem-
perature for prelaunch be maintained at 300.0 +8.3°K (80 +15°F). Aft
compartment prelaunch ambient temperatures are shown in Figure 18-2.
The lowest prelaunch temperature recorded was 287°K (58°F) at instrument
C107-115. This low temperature occurred prior to LOX loading and did not
cause any problems. Aft compartment ambient temperatures for flight are
also shown in Figure 18-2. The lowest temperature recorded was 285°K
(54°F) at instrument C203-115.
18.3 S-II ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
The engine compartment conditioning system maintained the ambient and
thrust cone surface temperature within design ranges throughout the launch
countdown. The system also maintained an inert atmosphere within the com-
partment.
There were no thermal control container temperature measurements; how-
ever, since the ambients external to the containers were satisfactory
and there were no problems with the equipment in the containers, it is
assumed that the thermal control systems performed adequately. The am-
bient temperature near the forward system was 44.5 to 85°K (80 to 152°F)
warmer than the extremes of past vehicles due to the increased effective-
ness of the foam insulation used on the S-II-6 hydrogen tank forward
bulkhead. Foam insulation reduced heat leakage from the engine compart-
ment and resulted in more uniform temperatures from container to container.
18.4 IU ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
The IU ECS is composed of a Thermal Conditioning System (TCS) and a Gas
Bearing Supply System (GBS). A preflight purge subsystem provided com-
partment conditioning prior to launch and maintained the compartment
temperature within the required 290 to 296°K (63 to 73°F) range.
18.4.1 Thermal Conditioning System
Initial sublimator start-up and sublimator performance parameters during
ascent are depicted in Figure 18-3. Immediately after liftoff, the Modu-
lating Flow Control Valve (MFCV) began driving toward the full heatsink

position which was reached at approximately 30 seconds. The water valve
opened at 181 seconds allowing water to flow to the sublimator. Immed-
iate cooling was evidenced by the rapid decline in the coolant fluid
temperature. At the first thermal switch sampling, the coolant tempera-
ture was still above the actuation point and the water valve remained
open. The second thermal switch sampling at approximately 780 seconds
resulted in closing of the water supply valve.
Coolant flowrates and pressures were well within required ranges as in-
dicated in Table 18-1.
An after mission experiment was performed in which the water supply valve
logic was inhibited (valve closed) to determine the effect of loss of
sublimator cooling. This was initiated approximately 5 hours after
liftoff. The Methanol/Water (M/W) supply temperature exceeded the
maximum scale range of 293°K (68°F) at about 23,200 seconds (Figure 18-4).
The TCS GN₂ sphere pressure decay which is indicative of GN₂ usage rate
was as expected for the nominal case as shown in Figure 18-5.

Figure 18-5. TCS GN₂ Sphere Pressure (D25-601)
All component temperatures remained within their expected ranges for the
duration of the mission (Figure 18-6). The ST-124M internal gimbal
(inertial) temperature (C34-603) went below operational temperature
range 313°K (104°F) (marginal operation) at about 4 hours. Lower tempera-
ture operation was also observed on AS-504 and AS-505, and is due to a
change in internal platform configuration (including axial blower) effect-
tive on AS-504 and subsequent. No degradation of platform performance has
been noted. The component temperatures all climbed as expected during the
ECS experiment and C34-603 went above its upper operating limit 319°K
(115°F) at about 9 hours (Figure 18-6).
18.4.2 Gas Bearing Supply System
The GN₂ pressure differential across the ST-124M platform gas bearings
drifted from an initial value of 10.48 N/cm2 (15.2 psid) at liftoff to
11.24 N/cm2 (16.3 psid) at 23,200 seconds (see Figure 18-7). The upper
limit of the specification value 10.7 N/cm2 (15.5 psid) was exceeded at
about 2500 seconds. The phenomenon of upward drifting of the pressure
differential has occurred on AS-501, AS-503, and AS-504 flights. Exten-
sive analysis and laboratory testing has indicated that the pressure

Figure 18-7. Inertial Platform GN₂ Pressures
differential discrepancy is a function of a number of variables acting
simultaneously with no single controlling factor. Although the gas
bearing pressure regulator as a component fulfills its functional re-
quirements, variables are introduced at a systems level which cause the
pressure differential drift.
The occurrence of a slightly higher pressure differential on previous
flights has resulted in no discernible effect on platform operation.
Vendor testing of the inertial platform at pressure differentials up to
13.8 N/cm2 (20 psid) have resulted in no degradation in platform perform-
ance.
An engineering change proposal is being considered to change the upper
limit of the specification to an acceptable value, which includes the
tolerance buildup of the system variables.
The GBS sphere pressure decay shown in Figure 18-8 was as expected. This
was an indication of normal GN₂ consumption.

DATA SYSTEMS
19.1 SUMMARY
All elements of the data system performed satisfactorily except for a
problem with the Command and Communications System (CCS) downlink during
translunar coast.
Measurement performance was excellent, as evidenced by 99.9 percent
reliability. This is the highest reliability attained on any Saturn V
flight.
Telemetry performance was nominal, with the exception of a minor calibra-
tion deviation. Very High Frequency (VHF) telemetry Radio Frequency (RF)
propagation was generally good, though the usual problems due to flame
effects and staging were experienced. Usable VHF data were received to
17,800 seconds (04:56:40). Command systems RF performance for both the
Secure Range Safety Command Systems (SRSCS) and CCS was nominal except
for the CCS downlink problem noted. Usable CCS data were received to
35,214 seconds (09:46:54).
Goldstone (GDS) received CCS signal carrier to 35,779 seconds (09:56:19).
Good tracking data were received from the C-Band radar, with Patrick Air
Force Base (PAFB) indicating final Loss of Signal (LOS) at 42,912 seconds
(11:55:12).
The 75 ground engineering cameras provided good data during the launch.
19.2 VEHICLE MEASUREMENT EVALUATION
The AS-506 launch vehicle had 1370 measurements scheduled for flight.
Eight measurements were waived prior to the start of the automatic count-
down sequence leaving 1362 measurements active for flight. Of the waived
measurements, five provided valid data during the flight.
Table 19-1 presents a summary of measurement performance for the total
vehicle and for each stage. Measurement performance was exceptionally
good, as evidenced by 99.9 percent reliability, which is the highest
attained on any Saturn V flight.

19.3 AIRBORNE TELEMETRY SYSTEMS
Performance of the eight VHF telemetry links was generally satisfactory
with the minor exceptions noted. A brief performance summary of these
links is shown in Table 19-4.
There was a variation of approximately 17 counts in the 100 percent level
of the inflight calibrations for the DP-1 telemetry link. This is equiv-
alent to 85 millivolts as compared to 41 millivolts in the specifications.
This type of variation is present in all other calibration levels to a
lesser degree. The data indicate the variation is from the Model 301 or
the Model 270 multiplexers and not the 5-volt measuring supply. This
problem, which also occurred on AS-505, is being investigated.
Data degradation and dropouts were experienced at various times during
boost as on previous flights due to attenuation of RF transmission, at
these times, as discussed in paragraph 19.4.1.
Usable VHF telemetry data were received to 17,800 seconds (04:56:40) at
Guaymas (GYM).
Performance of the CCS telemetry was generally satisfactory except for the
period during translunar coast from 27,128 seconds (07:32:08) to 35,779
seconds (09:56:19). This problem is discussed in detail in paragraph
19.4.3.2. Usable CCS data were received at GDS to 35,214 seconds (09:46:54).

19.4 RF SYSTEMS EVALUATION
19.4.1 Telemetry System RF Propagation Evaluation
The performance of the eight VHF telemetry links was excellent and gener-
ally agreed with predictions. VHF telemetry links AF-2, AF-3, AS-1, AS-2,
BF-3, BS-1, BS-2, CF-1 and CS-1 were deleted on AS-506.
Moderate to severe signal attenuation was experienced at various times
during the boost due to main flame effects, S-IC/S-II and S-II/S-IVB
staging, S-II ignition and S-II second plane separation. Magnitude of
these effects was comparable to that experienced on previous flights. At
S-IC/S-II staging, signal strength on all VHF telemetry links and on the
CCS downlink dropped to threshold for approximately 2 and 7 seconds,
respectively. Signal degradation due to S-II ignition and S-II flame
effects was sufficient to cause loss of VHF telemetry data on the S-IC and
S-II stages. CCS and S-II VHF data were lost during S-II second plane
separation. In addition, there were intervals during the launch phase
where some data were so degraded as to be unusable. Loss of these data,
however, posed no problem since losses were of such short duration as to
have little or no impact on flight analysis.
The performance of the S-IVB and IU telemetry systems was nominal during
orbit, second burn and final coast, except for the CCS problem discussed
in paragraph 19.4.3.2.
GYM reported VHF LOS at 17,800 seconds (04:56:40) and GDS reported CCS
LOS at 35,779 seconds (09:56:19).
A summary of available VHF telemetry coverage showing Acquisition of
Signal (AOS) and LOS for each station is shown in Figure 19-1.
19.4.2 Tracking Systems RF Propagation Evaluation
Analysis of data received to date indicates that the C-Band radar functioned
satisfactorily during this flight, although several ground stations experi-
enced some tracking problems.
The only problems reported during launch occurred at Cape Kennedy (CNV),
Merritt Island Launch Area (MILA), and Grand Turk Island (GTK). All three
stations lost track due to balance point shifts (erroneous pointing infor-
mation caused by a sudden vehicle antenna null or a distorted beacon
return). CNV and MILA went off track momentarily at 100 and 395 seconds,
respectively. GTK had dropouts due to balance point shifts at 241 seconds
(momentarily), from 535 to 538, from 555 to 570, from 572 to 580, from
594 to 599 and from 606 to 614 seconds. The highest elevation angle
encountered by GTK during this period was 3 degrees. MILA went off track
from 440 to 480 seconds due to interference from an electrical storm.
Bermuda (BDA) did not report any problems during launch.

Figure 19-1. VHF Telemetry Coverage Summary
19-7

--- PAGE 230 ---
Problems experienced during earth orbit included tracking on a sidelobe
by Vanguard (VAN) (revolution 2) and a phasing problem experienced by GTK
(revolution 2). This type phasing problem is experienced when a ground
station receives two closely spaced beacon returns; one generated as a
result of its own interrogation and one resulting from the interrogation
of the beacon by another ground station.
GTK lost track during translunar coast from 27,126 seconds (07:32:06) to
29,260 seconds (08:07:40) when attempting to phase away from the beacon
return pulse of another ground station. PAFB indicated final LOS at
42,912 seconds (11:55:12).
A summary of available C-Band radar coverage showing AOS and LOS for each
station is shown in Figure 19-2.
There is no mandatory tracking requirement of the CCS; however, the CCS
transponder has turnaround ranging capabilities and provided a backup to
the Command and Service Module (CSM) transponder used for tracking in case
of failure or desire for a cross check. Since the same transponder is used
for all CCS functions, discussion of the tracking performance of this system
is included in the general discussion of the CCS RF evaluation.
19.4.3 Command Systems RF Evaluation
19.4.3.1 Secure Range Safety Command System. VHF telemetry measurements
received by the ground stations from the S-IC, S-II and S-IVB stages
indicated that the SRSCS RF subsystems functioned properly. CNV and BDA
were the command stations used for this flight. The carrier signal at
CNV was turned off at approximately 400 seconds. At BDA the carrier was
turned on at approximately 375 seconds and turned off at approximately
750 seconds. A momentary dropout occurred at approximately 120 seconds
when the command station switched transmitting antennas.
19.4.3.2 Command and Communications System. Available data indicated
satisfactory CCS performance during boost and parking orbit with minor
exceptions. Uplink and downlink dropouts occurred during S-IC/S-II
staging and at S-II second plane separation. Dropouts at these times are
expected. Performance during second burn and translunar injection was
nominal.
Signal fluctuations were noted at HAW, GBM, GDS, and GYM from about
11,100 seconds (03:05:00) to 11,340 seconds (03:09:00) when the CSM was
maneuvered to an inertial attitude. This inertial attitude was maintained
during CSM separation, docking and Lunar Module (LM) ejection.
HAW lost track during translunar coast from 11,756 seconds (03:15:56) to
18,516 seconds (05:08:36) when the vehicle disappeared over the horizon.

--- PAGE 232 ---
A ground command was transmitted at 17,466.6 seconds (04:51:06.6) to
initiate Time Base 8. The vehicle was placed in a slingshot attitude
and the LOX dump followed. These events produced signal strength
fluctuations from 17,470 seconds (04:51:10) to 19,060 seconds (05:17:40)
at all stations tracking the CCS. The most severe fluctuations were
experienced at GBM and resulted in 25 dropouts during this time period.
These signal fluctuations were smooth and are believed to have been caused
by changing vehicle antenna gains as the look angles to the ground stations
varied with the changes in vehicle attitude (referenced to the ground
station).
A sharp drop in downlink CCS signal was noted at HAW, GBM, GDS and GYM at
27,128 seconds (07:32:08). The onboard antenna system, which had been on
the low gain since 19,034 seconds (05:17:14) was switched to the high gain
mode at 27,368 seconds (07:36:08) to improve signal quality. Signal
strength picked up and was maintained at a high level until 30,264 seconds
(08:24:24) at which time the signal level again dropped. In an attempt
to improve signal quality the CCS RF was switched OFF/ON two times and the
CCS antennas were switched several times. However, signal level fluctuated
intermittently at low levels until LOS at 35,779 (09:56:19). Figure 19-3
shows the fluctuations in signal level experienced at the HAW site. The
GDS wing station experienced similar fluctuations at corresponding times
as shown in Figure 19-4.

Figure 19-4. CCS Signal Strength Fluctuations at GDS Wing Station
The above indicates that the problem was present on low gain, high gain
and omni antenna; therefore, it is concluded that the drop in signal level
was caused by a malfunction of the CCS coaxial switch. On AS-505, a
similar problem in the CCS antenna system occurred only while transmitting
on the high gain or low gain antenna.
Test performed in IBM Report Number 69-223-0007 also concluded that the
CCS coaxial switch (the only electromechanical component which is common to
all CCS antennas) caused the failure. The general characteristics of the
CCS operation, as observed on AS-505 and AS-506, was duplicated by a simu-
lated leak in the hermetically sealed portion of the coaxial switch case.
In addition, engineering tests have demonstrated that the coaxial switch
will leak following vibration levels seen on AS-505 and AS-506.
19-11

--- PAGE 234 ---
Directional antenna tests did not duplicate the failure. Power amplifier
tests showed a leak in the power amplifier would cause a total failure;
this results in total loss of CCS downlink with no possible recovery.
Prior to any observed deficiencies in the flight operation of the CCS,
incorporation of a new design coaxial switch was programed for AS-507
and subsequent vehicles. The new switch exhibits none of the general
deficiencies of the earlier components and has shown no susceptibility
to failure in simulated leak tests or at vibration levels in excess of the
AS-505 or AS-506 vibration levels.
A summary of CCS coverage showing AOS and LOS for each station is shown
in Figure 19-5.
19.5 OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION
In general, ground camera coverage was very good. Seventy-five items
were received from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and evaluated. One camera
jammed before acquiring requested data. Two cameras had bad tracking items,
one camera had its field of view misoriented and one camera had no run. As
a result of the 5 failures listed above, system efficiency was 94 percent.
All Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) cameras had erratic timing; therefore, all
timing data were interpolated. Personnel at KSC have traced the timing
problem to a loose connector at the base of the Launch Control Center (LCC).

SECTION 20
MASS CHARACTERISTICS
20.1 SUMMARY
Postflight analysis indicates that total vehicle mass was within 0.50
percent of the prediction from ground ignition through S-IVB stage final
shutdown. This very small deviation signifies that the initial pro-
pellant loads and propellant utilization throughout vehicle operation
were close to predicted.
20.2 MASS EVALUATION
Postflight mass characteristics are compared with the final predicted
mass characteristics (MSFC Memorandum S&E-ASTN-SAE-69-M-70) and the
final operational trajectory (MSFC Memorandum S&E-AERO-FMT-138-69).
The postflight mass characteristics were determined from an analysis of
all available actual and reconstructed data from S-IC stage ignition
through S-IVB stage second burn cutoff. Dry weights of the launch vehi-
cle were based on actual stage weighings and evaluation of the weight
and balance log books (MSFC Form 998). Propellant loading and utiliza-
tion was evaluated from propulsion system performance reconstructions.
Spacecraft data were obtained from the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC).
Deviations from predicted in dry weights of the inert stages and the
loaded spacecraft were all less than 0.75 percent which was well within
the 3-sigma deviation limit.
During S-IC powered flight, mass of the total vehicle was determined to
be 2906 kilograms (6407 1bm) or 0.09 percent lower than predicted at
ignition, and 1366 kilograms (3011 1bm) or 0.16 percent lower at S-IC/
S-II separation. These small deviations are attributed to less than
predicted S-IC propellant load, S-IC dry stage mass, and mass of the
upper staging. S-IC burn phase total vehicle mass is shown in Tables
20-1 and 20-2.
During S-II burn phase, the total vehicle mass varied from 898 kilograms
(1981 1bm) or 0.13 percent lower than predicted at start command to 875
kilograms (1930 1bm) or 0.42 percent higher than predicted at S-II/S-IVB
separation. Most of the initial deviation may be attributed to a less
than predicted S-II propellant loading, and the deviation at separation
20-1

--- PAGE 238 ---
was due mainly to higher than predicted S-II propellant residuals. Total
vehicle mass for the S-II burn phase is shown in Tables 20-3 and 20-4.
Total vehicle mass during both S-IVB burn phases, as shown in Tables 20-5
through 20-8, was within 0.45 percent of prediction. A deviation of 143
kilograms (317 1bm) or 0.09 percent at first start command was due mainly
to a slight excess of S-IVB propellants. Lower than predicted propellant
residuals at end of first burn resulted in a 607 kilogram (1340 1bm) or
0.44 percent deviation. Total vehicle mass at spacecraft separation was
832 kilograms (1834 1bm) or 4.62 percent less than predicted.
A summary of mass utilization and loss, actual and predicted, from S-IC
stage ignition through completion of S-IVB second burn is presented in
Table 20-9. A comparison of actual and predicted mass, center of gravity,
and moment of inertia is shown in Table 20-10.

SECTION 23
SPACECRAFT SUMMARY
The purpose of the Apollo 11 mission was to land men on the lunar surface
and to return them safely. The crew was Neil A. Armstrong, Commander;
Michael Collins, Command Module (CM) Pilot; and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr.,
Lunar Module (LM) Pilot.
The space vehicle was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida,
at 9:32:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), July 16, 1969. The activi-
ties during earth orbit checkout, Translunar Injection (TLI), trans-
position and docking, spacecraft ejection, and translunar coast were
similar to those of Apollo 10. Only one midcourse correction, performed
at about 27 hours Ground Elapsed Time (GET), was required during trans-
lunar coast.
The spacecraft was inserted into lunar orbit at approximately 76 hours,
and the circularization maneuver was performed two revolutions later.
Initial checkout of LM systems was satisfactory, and after a planned
rest period, the Commander and LM Pilot entered the LM to prepare for
descent.
The two spacecraft were undocked at 100 hours, followed by separation
of the Command and Service Modules (CSM) from the LM. Descent orbit
insertion was performed at about 101.5 hours, and powered descent to
the lunar surface began about 1 hour later. Operation of the guidance
and descent propulsion systems was nominal. During the final 2.5 minutes
of descent, the LM was maneuvered manually approximately 305 meters (1000
ft) downrange. The spacecraft landed in the Sea of Tranquility at
102:45:40. The landing coordinates were 0.647 degree north latitude and
23.505 degrees east longitude, based on identification of landmarks from
the onboard sequence camera. During the first 2 hours on the surface,
the two crewmen performed a postlanding checkout of all LM systems.
Afterwards they ate their first meal on the moon and elected to perform.
the surface operations earlier than planned.
Considerable time was devoted to checkout and donning of the back-mounted
portable life support and oxygen purge systems. The Commander egressed
through the forward hatch and deployed an equipment module in the descent
stage. A camera in this module provided live television coverage of the
Commander descending the ladder to the surface, with first contact made
23-1

--- PAGE 258 ---
at 109:24:19 (10:56:19 p.m. EDT, July 20, 1969). The LM Pilot egressed
soon thereafter, and both crewmen used the initial period on the surface
to become acclimated to the reduced gravity and new surface conditions.
A contingency sample was taken from the surface, and the television
camera was deployed so that most of the LM was included in its view field.
The crew took numerous photographs, erected a U.S. flag, and activated
the scientific experiments, which included a solar wind detector, a
passive seismometer, and a laser reflector. The LM Pilot spent consider-
able time evaluating his ability to operate and move about, and despite
the limitations imposed by the pressurized suit, he was able to translate
rapidly and with confidence. Approximately 24 kilograms (54 1bm) of bulk
surface material were collected to be returned for analysis. The crew
reentered the LM at 111:39:00, with surface exploration lasting 2 hours,
31 minutes.
Ascent preparation was conducted efficiently, and the ascent stage lifted
off the surface at 124.5 hours. A nominal firing of the ascent engine
placed the vehicle into an 83 by 17 kilometer (45 by 9 n mi) orbit.
After a rendezvous sequence similar to that of Apollo 10, the two space-
craft were docked at 128 hours. Following transfer of the crew, the
ascent stage was jettisoned, and the Command and Service Modules were
prepared for transearth injection.
The return flight started with a 150-second firing of the service propul-
sion engine during the 31st lunar revolution at 135.5 hours. As in trans-
lunar flight, only one midcourse correction was required, and passive
thermal control was exercised for most of transearth coast. The possi-
bility of inclement weather necessitated moving the landing point 398
kilometers (215 n mi) downrange. The entry phase was normal, and the CM
landed in the Pacific Ocean at 195:18:35. The landing coordinates, as
determined from the onboard computer, were 13.3 degrees north latitude
and 169.4 degrees west longitude.
After landing, the crew donned biological isolation garments and were re-
trieved by helicopter and taken to the primary recovery ship, USS Hornet.
The crew then entered the Mobile Quarantine Facility, which arrived at
the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston on Sunday, July 27, 1969. The
CM was taken aboard the Hornet about 3 hours after landing. The lunar
samples arrived at the Receiving Laboratory the day after landing.
For further details on the spacecraft performance, refer to the Apollo 11
Mission Report published by NASA Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston,

APPENDIX A
ATMOSPHERE
A.1 SUMMARY
This appendix presents a summary of the atmospheric environment at launch
time of the AS-506. The format of these data is similar to that presented
on previous launches of Saturn vehicles to permit comparisons. Surface
and upper winds, and thermodynamic data near the launch time are given.
A.2 GENERAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AT LAUNCH TIME
A high pressure cell, in the Atlantic Ocean off the North Carolina coast,
along with a weak trough of low pressure located in the northeastern Gulf
of Mexico caused light southerly surface winds and brought moisture into
the Cape Kennedy, Florida area, which contributed to the cloudy conditions
and distant thunderstorms that were observed during launch.
A.3 SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AT LAUNCH TIME
At launch time, total sky cover was 9/10 with 1/10 cumulus at 0.7 kilo-
meter (2400 ft), 2/10 altocumulus at 4.6 kilometers (15,000 ft) and 9/10
cirrostratus at an unknown altitude. Surface observations at launch time
are summarized in Table A-1. Solar radiation data are given in Table A-2.
A.4 UPPER AIR MEASUREMENTS
Data were used from three of the upper air wind systems to compile the
final meteorological tape. Table A-3 summarizes the data systems used.
A.4.1 Wind Speed
Wind speed was light in the lower levels. In the maximum dynamic pressure
region a peak speed of 9.6 m/s (18.7 knots) was observed at 11.40 kilo-
meters (37,400 ft). At higher altitudes the wind speed increased stead-
ily, as shown in Figure A-1.
A.4.2 Wind Direction
The surface wind was from the south, but with altitude shifted clockwise
through west, north and then stayed easterly above 16 kilometers (52,490
ft) altitude, as shown in Figure A-2.

A.4.3 Pitch Wind Component
The surface pitch wind speed component was a tail wind of 0.3 m/s (0.6
knots). A maximum tail wind of 7.6 m/s (14.8 knots) was observed at
11.18 kilometers (36,680 ft) altitude. Head winds were observed above
15.0 kilometers (49,210 ft) altitude. See Figure A-3.
A.4.4 Yaw Wind Component
The yaw wind speed component was a wind from the right at the surface to
approximately 9.0 kilometers (29,530 ft) altitude. Winds from the left
prevailed above this altitude to 16.3 kilometers (53,480 ft) with a peak
yaw wind speed of 7.1 m/s (13.8 knots) at 12.1 kilometers (39,530 ft)
altitude. Above 16.3 kilometers (53,480 ft) yaw winds were from the
right. See Figure A-4.
A.4.5 Component Wind Shears
The largest component wind shear (Ah = 1000 m) in the altitude range of
8 to 16 kilometers (26,247 to 52,493 ft) was a pitch shear of 0.0077 sec-¹
at 14.8 kilometers (48,490 ft). The largest yaw wind shear, in the lower
levels, was 0.0056 sec-1 at 10.3 kilometers (33,790 ft). See Figure A-5.

the Patrick Reference Atmosphere, 1963 (PRA-63) for temperature, density,
pressure, and Optical Index of Refraction are shown in Figures A-6 and
A-7 and discussed in the following paragraphs.
A.5.1 Temperature
Atmospheric temperature deviations were small, being less than 3 percent
deviation from the PRA-63. At most altitudes, the temperature was warmer
than the PRA-63.

A.5.2 Atmospheric Pressure
Atmospheric pressure deviations remained greater than the PRA-63 values
at all altitudes. Surface pressure was 0.2 percent greater than the PRA-
63 and increased to a peak deviation of 9.0 percent at 44.0 kilometers
(144,360 ft).
A.5.3 Atmospheric Density
Atmospheric density deviations were small, being less than 5 percent de-
viation from the PRA-63 from the .surface to 29.8 kilometers (97,770 ft)
altitude. Density deviations increased above this altitude and reached
a peak of 10.3 percent at 46.0 kilometers (150,920 ft). Surface atmos-
pheric density was -2.1 percent of the PRA-63 surface density.

APPENDIX B
AS-506 SIGNIFICANT CONFIGURATION CHANGES
B.1 INTRODUCTION
AS-506, sixth flight of the Saturn V series, was the fourth manned
Apollo Saturn V vehicle. The AS-506 launch vehicle was configured the
same as the AS-505 with significant exceptions as shown in Tables B-1
through B-4. The basic AS-506 Apollo 11 spacecraft structure and
components were unchanged from the AS-504 Apollo 9 configuration except
